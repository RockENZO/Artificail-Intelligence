      "\n",
      "The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and\n",
      "conceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate\n",
      "into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\n",
      "things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\n",
      "Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\n",
      "being charming. This is a fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\n",
      "cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\n",
      "beautiful things mean only beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\n",
      "written, or badly written. That is all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\n",
      "his own face in a glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\n",
      "not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\n",
      "the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\n",
      "the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\n",
      "anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\n",
      "ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\n",
      "mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\n",
      "everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\n",
      "art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\n",
      "point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\n",
      "musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the\n",
      "type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\n",
      "surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\n",
      "peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\n",
      "Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\n",
      "complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\n",
      "himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\n",
      "does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\n",
      "one admires it intensely.\n",

      "The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\n",
      "summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\n",
      "the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\n",
      "perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\n",
      "lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\n",
      "Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\n",
      "blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\n",
      "bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\n",
      "the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\n",
      "tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\n",
      "producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\n",
      "those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\n",
      "an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\n",
      "swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\n",
      "way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\n",
      "insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\n",
      "seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\n",
      "was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\n",
      "full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\n",
      "and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\n",
      "himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\n",
      "caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\n",
      "strange conjectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\n",
      "skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\n",
      "face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\n",
      "closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\n",
      "to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\n",
      "might awake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said\n",
      "Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\n",
      "Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\n",
      "gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\n",
      "able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\n",
      "I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\n",
      "is really the only place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head\n",
      "back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\n",
      "Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\n",
      "the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\n",
      "from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear\n",
      "fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\n",
      "do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\n",
      "you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\n",
      "only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\n",
      "not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\n",
      "all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\n",
      "old men are ever capable of any emotion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit\n",
      "it. I have put too much of myself into it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\n",
      "were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\n",
      "your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\n",
      "Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\n",
      "my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\n",
      "intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\n",
      "where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\n",
      "of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\n",
      "sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\n",
      "horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\n",
      "How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\n",
      "then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\n",
      "age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\n",
      "and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\n",
      "Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\n",
      "whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\n",
      "that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\n",
      "in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\n",
      "when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter\n",
      "yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am\n",
      "not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\n",
      "look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\n",
      "There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\n",
      "the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\n",
      "steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\n",
      "The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\n",
      "at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\n",
      "they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\n",
      "should live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\n",
      "neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\n",
      "Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\n",
      "whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\n",
      "for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the\n",
      "studio towards Basil Hallward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\n",
      "names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\n",
      "to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\n",
      "mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\n",
      "one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\n",
      "am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\n",
      "I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\n",
      "one’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\n",
      "to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\n",
      "makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\n",
      "never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\n",
      "When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\n",
      "down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\n",
      "most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\n",
      "than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\n",
      "when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\n",
      "she would; but she merely laughs at me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\n",
      "Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\n",
      "believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\n",
      "thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\n",
      "fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\n",
      "Your cynicism is simply a pose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”\n",
      "cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\n",
      "garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\n",
      "stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\n",
      "polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\n",
      "going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\n",
      "answering a question I put to you some time ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know quite well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not, Harry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\n",
      "won’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you the real reason.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\n",
      "yourself in it. Now, that is childish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\n",
      "portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\n",
      "of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\n",
      "not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\n",
      "the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\n",
      "this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\n",
      "my own soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\n",
      "over his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;\n",
      "“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\n",
      "believe it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\n",
      "the grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\n",
      "replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\n",
      "“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\n",
      "is quite incredible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\n",
      "lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\n",
      "languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\n",
      "blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\n",
      "wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart\n",
      "beating, and wondered what was coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two\n",
      "months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor\n",
      "artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\n",
      "remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\n",
      "white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\n",
      "a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\n",
      "about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\n",
      "academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\n",
      "me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\n",
      "When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\n",
      "of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\n",
      "one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\n",
      "do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\n",
      "itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\n",
      "yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\n",
      "own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\n",
      "Then—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\n",
      "tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\n",
      "a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\n",
      "exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\n",
      "not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\n",
      "no credit to myself for trying to escape.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\n",
      "is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.\n",
      "However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used\n",
      "to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\n",
      "stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,\n",
      "Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\n",
      "pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\n",
      "with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\n",
      "parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\n",
      "once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\n",
      "some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\n",
      "been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\n",
      "nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\n",
      "face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\n",
      "stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\n",
      "It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\n",
      "Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\n",
      "would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\n",
      "that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\n",
      "to know each other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his\n",
      "companion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her\n",
      "guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\n",
      "gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\n",
      "ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\n",
      "everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\n",
      "like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\n",
      "exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\n",
      "entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\n",
      "to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\n",
      "listlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\n",
      "opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\n",
      "say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely\n",
      "inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do\n",
      "anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’\n",
      "Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\n",
      "the best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\n",
      "Harry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\n",
      "one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\n",
      "and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\n",
      "glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\n",
      "summer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\n",
      "between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\n",
      "acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\n",
      "intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\n",
      "have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\n",
      "power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\n",
      "me? I think it is rather vain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\n",
      "merely an acquaintance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,\n",
      "and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my\n",
      "relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\n",
      "other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\n",
      "with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\n",
      "of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\n",
      "immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\n",
      "us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\n",
      "poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\n",
      "magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\n",
      "proletariat live correctly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\n",
      "more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\n",
      "patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\n",
      "Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\n",
      "puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\n",
      "never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\n",
      "only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\n",
      "oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\n",
      "the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\n",
      "are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\n",
      "will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\n",
      "wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to\n",
      "discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\n",
      "better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\n",
      "than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\n",
      "How often do you see him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is\n",
      "absolutely necessary to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\n",
      "your art.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes\n",
      "think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\n",
      "world’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\n",
      "and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\n",
      "What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\n",
      "Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\n",
      "some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\n",
      "him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\n",
      "more to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am\n",
      "dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\n",
      "that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\n",
      "and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\n",
      "work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder\n",
      "will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely\n",
      "new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\n",
      "differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\n",
      "way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\n",
      "thought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\n",
      "has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to\n",
      "me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\n",
      "visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\n",
      "Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\n",
      "that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\n",
      "perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\n",
      "body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\n",
      "have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\n",
      "Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\n",
      "landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\n",
      "which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\n",
      "done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\n",
      "sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\n",
      "first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\n",
      "always looked for and always missed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\n",
      "some time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply\n",
      "a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\n",
      "He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\n",
      "He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\n",
      "curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\n",
      "colours. That is all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\n",
      "all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\n",
      "cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\n",
      "anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\n",
      "soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\n",
      "their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too\n",
      "much of myself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\n",
      "is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create\n",
      "beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\n",
      "live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\n",
      "autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\n",
      "will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\n",
      "never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only\n",
      "the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\n",
      "fond of you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered\n",
      "after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\n",
      "I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\n",
      "be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\n",
      "in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\n",
      "is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\n",
      "pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\n",
      "one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\n",
      "decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\n",
      "“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\n",
      "of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\n",
      "accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\n",
      "ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\n",
      "something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\n",
      "facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\n",
      "well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\n",
      "thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\n",
      "_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\n",
      "its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\n",
      "you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\n",
      "out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You\n",
      "will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\n",
      "he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\n",
      "perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\n",
      "alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\n",
      "one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\n",
      "that it leaves one so unromantic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\n",
      "Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change\n",
      "too often.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\n",
      "faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\n",
      "know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\n",
      "silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\n",
      "satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\n",
      "a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\n",
      "and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\n",
      "swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\n",
      "people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it\n",
      "seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those\n",
      "were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\n",
      "amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\n",
      "with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure\n",
      "to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\n",
      "been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\n",
      "lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\n",
      "virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\n",
      "The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\n",
      "eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\n",
      "all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\n",
      "turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remembered what, Harry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told\n",
      "me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\n",
      "in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\n",
      "that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\n",
      "of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\n",
      "earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\n",
      "creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\n",
      "about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want you to meet him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t want me to meet him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\n",
      "the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\n",
      "“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man\n",
      "bowed and went up the walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\n",
      "said. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\n",
      "right in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence\n",
      "him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\n",
      "marvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who\n",
      "gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\n",
      "depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and\n",
      "the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\n",
      "by the arm, he almost led him into the house.\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\n",
      "his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s\n",
      "“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to\n",
      "learn them. They are perfectly charming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\n",
      "myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\n",
      "wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\n",
      "blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your\n",
      "pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\n",
      "have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\n",
      "have spoiled everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord\n",
      "Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\n",
      "spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\n",
      "afraid, one of her victims also.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a\n",
      "funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\n",
      "with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\n",
      "have played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what\n",
      "she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\n",
      "And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\n",
      "audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\n",
      "the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,\n",
      "laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,\n",
      "with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp\n",
      "gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at\n",
      "once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s\n",
      "passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the\n",
      "world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too\n",
      "charming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened\n",
      "his cigarette-case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes\n",
      "ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last\n",
      "remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\n",
      "“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it\n",
      "awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky\n",
      "moods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell\n",
      "me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a\n",
      "subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly\n",
      "shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t\n",
      "really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your\n",
      "sitters to have some one to chat to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\n",
      "Dorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,\n",
      "but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the\n",
      "Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon\n",
      "Street. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when\n",
      "you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\n",
      "too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\n",
      "horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\n",
      "him to stay. I insist upon it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\n",
      "gazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I\n",
      "am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\n",
      "for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\n",
      "that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\n",
      "and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\n",
      "says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\n",
      "exception of myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\n",
      "martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\n",
      "he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\n",
      "delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\n",
      "moments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\n",
      "Henry? As bad as Basil says?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\n",
      "immoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does\n",
      "not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\n",
      "virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\n",
      "sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an\n",
      "actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\n",
      "self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each\n",
      "of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\n",
      "forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s\n",
      "self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\n",
      "the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\n",
      "out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\n",
      "which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\n",
      "religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\n",
      "boy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\n",
      "had come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\n",
      "that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\n",
      "him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man\n",
      "were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\n",
      "every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I\n",
      "believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\n",
      "would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the\n",
      "Hellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\n",
      "may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\n",
      "mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\n",
      "that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\n",
      "that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\n",
      "sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\n",
      "purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\n",
      "or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\n",
      "to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\n",
      "the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\n",
      "monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\n",
      "the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\n",
      "brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\n",
      "also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\n",
      "rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\n",
      "thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\n",
      "dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what\n",
      "to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.\n",
      "Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\n",
      "eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\n",
      "influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\n",
      "really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to\n",
      "him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\n",
      "them—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\n",
      "but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\n",
      "music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\n",
      "chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\n",
      "were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\n",
      "And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\n",
      "to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\n",
      "own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\n",
      "so real as words?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\n",
      "He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\n",
      "seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\n",
      "it?\n",
      "\n",
      "With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\n",
      "psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\n",
      "He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\n",
      "and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\n",
      "which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\n",
      "wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\n",
      "He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\n",
      "fascinating the lad was!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\n",
      "the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\n",
      "only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go\n",
      "out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of\n",
      "anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And\n",
      "I have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright\n",
      "look in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but\n",
      "he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose\n",
      "he has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he\n",
      "says.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the\n",
      "reason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his\n",
      "dreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is\n",
      "horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,\n",
      "something with strawberries in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\n",
      "tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I\n",
      "will join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been\n",
      "in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my\n",
      "masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his\n",
      "face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\n",
      "perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand\n",
      "upon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.\n",
      "“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the\n",
      "senses but the soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\n",
      "tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There\n",
      "was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are\n",
      "suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some\n",
      "hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of\n",
      "life—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means\n",
      "of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think\n",
      "you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking\n",
      "the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,\n",
      "olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was\n",
      "something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His\n",
      "cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,\n",
      "as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.\n",
      "But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been\n",
      "left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil\n",
      "Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\n",
      "him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to\n",
      "have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be\n",
      "afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be\n",
      "frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought\n",
      "out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\n",
      "quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must\n",
      "not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on\n",
      "the seat at the end of the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\n",
      "worth having.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and\n",
      "ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\n",
      "branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will\n",
      "feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it\n",
      "always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.\n",
      "Don’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher,\n",
      "indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great\n",
      "facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in\n",
      "dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be\n",
      "questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of\n",
      "those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t\n",
      "smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That\n",
      "may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,\n",
      "beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not\n",
      "judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\n",
      "the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But\n",
      "what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in\n",
      "which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your\n",
      "beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there\n",
      "are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those\n",
      "mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than\n",
      "defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something\n",
      "dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your\n",
      "roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You\n",
      "will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.\n",
      "Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying\n",
      "to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the\n",
      "ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the\n",
      "false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!\n",
      "Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.\n",
      "Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.\n",
      "You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing\n",
      "you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment\n",
      "I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,\n",
      "of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me\n",
      "that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how\n",
      "tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time\n",
      "that your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers\n",
      "wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next\n",
      "June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the\n",
      "clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold\n",
      "its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy\n",
      "that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses\n",
      "rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the\n",
      "passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite\n",
      "temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!\n",
      "There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell\n",
      "from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for\n",
      "a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe\n",
      "of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in\n",
      "trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make\n",
      "us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we\n",
      "cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays\n",
      "sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the\n",
      "bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian\n",
      "convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and\n",
      "fro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made\n",
      "staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and\n",
      "smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and\n",
      "you can bring your drinks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white\n",
      "butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of\n",
      "the garden a thrush began to sing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.\n",
      "Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to\n",
      "make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only\n",
      "difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice\n",
      "lasts a little longer.”\n",

      "As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s\n",
      "arm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,\n",

      "resumed his pose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.\n",
      "The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that\n",
      "broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back\n",
      "to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that\n",
      "streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The\n",
      "heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for\n",
      "a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,\n",
      "biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite\n",
      "finished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in\n",
      "long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a\n",
      "wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the\n",
      "finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly\n",
      "to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr.\n",
      "Gray?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture\n",
      "and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks\n",
      "flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,\n",
      "as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there\n",
      "motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to\n",
      "him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own\n",
      "beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.\n",
      "Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the\n",
      "charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed\n",
      "at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had\n",
      "come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his\n",
      "terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and\n",
      "now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full\n",
      "reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a\n",
      "day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and\n",
      "colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet\n",
      "would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The\n",
      "life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become\n",
      "dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a\n",
      "knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes\n",
      "deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt\n",
      "as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the\n",
      "lad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is\n",
      "one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you\n",
      "like to ask for it. I must have it.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“He is a very lucky fellow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon\n",
      "his own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and\n",
      "dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be\n",
      "older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other\n",
      "way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was\n",
      "to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is\n",
      "nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for\n",
      "that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord\n",
      "Henry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You\n",
      "like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a\n",
      "green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like\n",
      "that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed\n",
      "and his cheeks burning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your\n",
      "silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till\n",
      "I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses\n",
      "one’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your\n",
      "picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth\n",
      "is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I\n",
      "shall kill myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried,\n",
      "“don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I\n",
      "shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,\n",
      "are you?—you who are finer than any of them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of\n",
      "the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must\n",
      "lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives\n",
      "something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture\n",
      "could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint\n",
      "it? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled\n",
      "into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the\n",
      "divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that is\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between\n",
      "you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\n",
      "done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will\n",
      "not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid\n",
      "face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal\n",
      "painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was\n",
      "he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin\n",
      "tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long\n",
      "palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at\n",
      "last. He was going to rip up the canvas.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\n",
      "Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of\n",
      "the studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It would be murder!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter\n",
      "coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought you\n",
      "would.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I\n",
      "feel that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and\n",
      "sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked\n",
      "across the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of\n",
      "course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple\n",
      "pleasures?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the last refuge\n",
      "of the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage. What\n",
      "absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as\n",
      "a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man\n",
      "is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after\n",
      "all—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You\n",
      "had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really\n",
      "want it, and I really do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!”\n",
      "cried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it\n",
      "existed.”\n",
      "\n",

      "There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden\n",
      "tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a\n",
      "rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.\n",
      "Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray\n",
      "went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to\n",
      "the table and examined what was under the covers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to\n",
      "be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it\n",
      "is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am\n",
      "ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent\n",

      "all the surprise of candour.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth\n",

      "real colour-element left in modern life.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Before either.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why,\n",
      "even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to\n",
      "do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old\n",
      "men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”\n",
      "\n",

      "At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon\n",
      "Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial\n",
      "if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called\n",
      "selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was\n",
      "considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His\n",
      "father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and\n",
      "Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a\n",
      "capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at\n",
      "Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by\n",
      "reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,\n",
      "and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his\n",
      "father’s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat\n",
      "foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months\n",
      "later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great\n",
      "aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town\n",
      "houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and\n",
      "took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the\n",
      "management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself\n",
      "for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of\n",
      "having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of\n",
      "burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when\n",
      "the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them\n",
      "for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied\n",
      "him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.\n",
      "Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the\n",
      "country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but\n",
      "there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough\n",
      "shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. “Well,\n",
      "Harry,” said the old gentleman, “what brings you out so early? I\n",
      "thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till\n",
      "five.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get\n",
      "something out of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. “Well, sit\n",
      "down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that\n",
      "money is everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; “and\n",
      "when they grow older they know it. But I don’t want money. It is only\n",
      "people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay\n",
      "mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly\n",
      "upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s tradesmen, and\n",
      "consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not\n",
      "useful information, of course; useless information.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,\n",
      "although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in\n",
      "the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in\n",
      "now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure\n",
      "humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite\n",
      "enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for\n",

      "\n",
      "“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who\n",
      "he is. He is the last Lord Kelso’s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,\n",
      "Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What\n",
      "was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in\n",
      "your time, so you might have known her. I am very much interested in\n",
      "Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman. “Kelso’s grandson! ... Of\n",
      "course.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her\n",
      "christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret\n",
      "Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless\n",
      "young fellow—a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or\n",
      "something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it\n",
      "happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few\n",
      "months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said\n",
      "Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his\n",
      "son-in-law in public—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him—and that the\n",
      "fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed\n",
      "up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time\n",
      "afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she\n",
      "never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl\n",
      "died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had\n",
      "forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he\n",
      "must be a good-looking chap.”\n",
      "\n",

      "by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,\n",
      "through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a\n",
      "mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I\n",
      "was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble\n",
      "who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made\n",
      "quite a story of it. I didn’t dare show my face at Court for a month. I\n",

      "understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was\n",
      "mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family\n",
      "were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.\n",
      "Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at\n",
      "him, and there wasn’t a girl in London at the time who wasn’t after\n",
      "him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this\n",

      "So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had\n",
      "been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a\n",
      "strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything\n",
      "for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a\n",
      "hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child\n",
      "born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to\n",
      "solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an\n",
      "interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it\n",
      "were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something\n",
      "tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might\n",
      "blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as\n",
      "with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat\n",
      "opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer\n",
      "rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing\n",
      "upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the\n",
      "bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of\n",
      "influence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into\n",
      "some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s\n",
      "own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of\n",
      "passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though\n",
      "it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in\n",
      "that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited\n",
      "and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and\n",
      "grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,\n",
      "whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be\n",
      "fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the\n",
      "white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for\n",
      "us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made\n",
      "a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to\n",
      "fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how\n",
      "interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at\n",
      "life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who\n",
      "was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim\n",
      "woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,\n",
      "Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there\n",
      "had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful\n",
      "things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it\n",
      "were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they\n",
      "were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose\n",
      "shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something\n",
      "like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had\n",
      "first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the\n",
      "coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was\n",
      "strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without\n",
      "knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful\n",
      "portrait. He would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done\n",
      "so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something\n",
      "fascinating in this son of love and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had\n",
      "passed his aunt’s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.\n",
      "When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they\n",
      "had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and\n",
      "passed into the dining-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Late as usual, Harry,” cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to\n",
      "her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from\n",
      "the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.\n",
      "Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and\n",
      "good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample\n",
      "architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are\n",
      "described by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on\n",
      "her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who\n",
      "followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the\n",
      "best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in\n",
      "accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left was\n",
      "occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable\n",
      "charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,\n",
      "having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he\n",
      "had to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,\n",
      "one of his aunt’s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so\n",
      "dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.\n",
      "Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most\n",
      "intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement\n",
      "in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely\n",
      "earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once\n",
      "himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of\n",
      "them ever quite escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” cried the duchess,\n",
      "nodding pleasantly to him across the table. “Do you think he will\n",
      "really marry this fascinating young person?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Agatha. “Really, some one should\n",
      "interfere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American\n",
      "dry-goods store,” said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?” asked the duchess, raising\n",
      "her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“American novels,” answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duchess looked puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t mind him, my dear,” whispered Lady Agatha. “He never means\n",
      "anything that he says.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When America was discovered,” said the Radical member—and he began to\n",
      "give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a\n",
      "subject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised\n",
      "her privilege of interruption. “I wish to goodness it never had been\n",
      "discovered at all!” she exclaimed. “Really, our girls have no chance\n",
      "nowadays. It is most unfair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,” said Mr.\n",
      "Erskine; “I myself would say that it had merely been detected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,” answered the\n",
      "duchess vaguely. “I must confess that most of them are extremely\n",
      "pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.\n",
      "I wish I could afford to do the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled Sir\n",
      "Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast-off clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired the\n",
      "duchess.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Thomas frowned. “I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against\n",
      "that great country,” he said to Lady Agatha. “I have travelled all over\n",
      "it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are\n",
      "extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr.\n",
      "Erskine plaintively. “I don’t feel up to the journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Thomas waved his hand. “Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on\n",
      "his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about\n",
      "them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are\n",
      "absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing\n",
      "characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I\n",
      "assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry. “I can stand brute force, but brute\n",
      "reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It\n",
      "is hitting below the intellect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the baronet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine. “I did not think so. Perhaps\n",
      "it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality\n",
      "we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we\n",
      "can judge them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue! I am sure I never can\n",
      "make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with\n",
      "you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the\n",
      "East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love\n",
      "his playing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked\n",
      "down the table and caught a bright answering glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry,\n",
      "shrugging his shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too\n",
      "ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid\n",
      "in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the\n",
      "colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life’s sores,\n",
      "the better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir Thomas\n",
      "with a grave shake of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite so,” answered the young lord. “It is the problem of slavery, and\n",
      "we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The politician looked at him keenly. “What change do you propose,\n",
      "then?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry laughed. “I don’t desire to change anything in England\n",
      "except the weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with philosophic\n",
      "contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through\n",
      "an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal\n",
      "to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that\n",
      "they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not\n",
      "emotional.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur\n",
      "timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. “Humanity takes itself too\n",
      "seriously. It is the world’s original sin. If the caveman had known how\n",
      "to laugh, history would have been different.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess. “I have always\n",
      "felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no\n",
      "interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look\n",
      "her in the face without a blush.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only when one is young,” she answered. “When an old woman like myself\n",
      "blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell\n",
      "me how to become young again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought for a moment. “Can you remember any great error that you\n",
      "committed in your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across\n",
      "the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A great many, I fear,” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then commit them over again,” he said gravely. “To get back one’s\n",
      "youth, one has merely to repeat one’s follies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A delightful theory!” she exclaimed. “I must put it into practice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A dangerous theory!” came from Sir Thomas’s tight lips. Lady Agatha\n",
      "shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the great secrets of life.\n",
      "Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and\n",
      "discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are\n",
      "one’s mistakes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A laugh ran round the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and\n",
      "transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent\n",
      "with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went\n",
      "on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and\n",
      "catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her\n",
      "wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the\n",
      "hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled\n",
      "before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge\n",
      "press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round\n",
      "her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over\n",
      "the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary\n",
      "improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,\n",
      "and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose\n",
      "temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and\n",
      "to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic,\n",
      "irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they\n",
      "followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,\n",
      "but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips\n",
      "and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room\n",
      "in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was\n",
      "waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. “How annoying!” she\n",
      "cried. “I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take\n",
      "him to some absurd meeting at Willis’s Rooms, where he is going to be\n",
      "in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn’t\n",
      "have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would\n",
      "ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are\n",
      "quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don’t know\n",
      "what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some\n",
      "night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,” said Lord Henry with a\n",
      "bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,” she cried; “so mind you\n",
      "come”; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the\n",
      "other ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking\n",
      "a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You talk books away,” he said; “why don’t you write one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I\n",
      "should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely\n",
      "as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in\n",
      "England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of\n",
      "all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty\n",
      "of literature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine. “I myself used to have\n",
      "literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young\n",
      "friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really\n",
      "meant all that you said to us at lunch?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry. “Was it all very bad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if\n",

      "tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your\n",

      "enough to possess.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious\n",
      "arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in Mayfair. It\n",
      "was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled\n",
      "wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling\n",
      "of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,\n",
      "long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette\n",
      "by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for\n",
      "Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies\n",
      "that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and\n",
      "parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small\n",
      "leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a\n",
      "summer day in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his\n",
      "principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was\n",
      "looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages\n",
      "of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had\n",
      "found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the\n",
      "Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. “How late you\n",
      "are, Harry!” he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” answered a shrill voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. “I beg your pardon. I\n",
      "thought—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me\n",
      "introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my\n",
      "husband has got seventeen of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the\n",
      "opera.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her\n",
      "vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always\n",
      "looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.\n",
      "She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never\n",
      "returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look\n",
      "picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria,\n",
      "and she had a perfect mania for going to church.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner’s music better than\n",
      "anybody’s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other\n",
      "people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don’t you\n",
      "think so, Mr. Gray?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her\n",
      "fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so, Lady\n",
      "Henry. I never talk during music—at least, during good music. If one\n",
      "hears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it in conversation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray? I always hear\n",
      "Harry’s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of\n",
      "them. But you must not think I don’t like good music. I adore it, but I\n",
      "am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped\n",
      "pianists—two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don’t know what it\n",
      "is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,\n",
      "ain’t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after\n",
      "a time, don’t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to\n",
      "art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it? You have never been to\n",
      "any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can’t afford\n",
      "orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one’s rooms\n",
      "look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for\n",
      "you, to ask you something—I forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray\n",
      "here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the\n",
      "same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been\n",
      "most pleasant. I am so glad I’ve seen him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating his\n",
      "dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused\n",
      "smile. “So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old\n",
      "brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays\n",
      "people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an\n",
      "awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. “I have promised to drive\n",
      "with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining\n",
      "out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her\n",
      "as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the\n",
      "rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of\n",
      "frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the\n",
      "sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,” he said after a\n",
      "few puffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Harry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because they are so sentimental.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I like sentimental people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,\n",
      "because they are curious: both are disappointed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That\n",
      "is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do\n",
      "everything that you say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “That is a rather commonplace\n",
      "_début_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never heard of her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They\n",
      "never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent\n",
      "the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of\n",
      "mind over morals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry, how can you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so\n",
      "I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I\n",
      "find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and\n",
      "the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a\n",
      "reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to\n",
      "supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake,\n",
      "however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers\n",
      "painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used\n",
      "to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten\n",
      "years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for\n",
      "conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and\n",
      "two of these can’t be admitted into decent society. However, tell me\n",
      "about your genius. How long have you known her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind that. How long have you known her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About three weeks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And where did you come across her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.\n",
      "After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You\n",
      "filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days\n",
      "after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in\n",
      "the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who\n",
      "passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they\n",
      "led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There\n",
      "was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations....\n",
      "Well, one evening about seven o’clock, I determined to go out in search\n",
      "of some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with\n",
      "its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as\n",
      "you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied a\n",
      "thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I\n",
      "remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we\n",
      "first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret\n",
      "of life. I don’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered\n",
      "eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black\n",
      "grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little\n",
      "theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous\n",
      "Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was\n",
      "standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets,\n",
      "and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ‘Have a\n",
      "box, my Lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an\n",
      "air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that\n",
      "amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I\n",
      "really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the\n",
      "present day I can’t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn’t—my dear\n",
      "Harry, if I hadn’t—I should have missed the greatest romance of my\n",
      "life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you\n",
      "should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the\n",
      "first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will\n",
      "always be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of\n",
      "people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes\n",
      "of a country. Don’t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for\n",
      "you. This is merely the beginning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I think your nature so deep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really\n",
      "the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I\n",
      "call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.\n",
      "Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life\n",
      "of the intellect—simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must\n",
      "analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many\n",
      "things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might\n",
      "pick them up. But I don’t want to interrupt you. Go on with your\n",
      "story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a\n",
      "vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the\n",
      "curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and\n",
      "cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were\n",
      "fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and\n",
      "there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the\n",
      "dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there\n",
      "was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what\n",
      "on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you\n",
      "think the play was, Harry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think ‘The Idiot Boy’, or ‘Dumb but Innocent’. Our fathers\n",
      "used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,\n",
      "the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is\n",
      "not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandpères ont\n",
      "toujours tort_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I\n",
      "must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare\n",
      "done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a\n",
      "sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There\n",
      "was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a\n",
      "cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene\n",
      "was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,\n",
      "with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a\n",
      "beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the\n",
      "low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most\n",
      "friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the\n",
      "scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But\n",
      "Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a\n",
      "little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of\n",
      "dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were\n",
      "like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen\n",
      "in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that\n",
      "beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,\n",
      "Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came\n",
      "across me. And her voice—I never heard such a voice. It was very low at\n",
      "first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s\n",
      "ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a\n",
      "distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy\n",
      "that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There\n",
      "were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You\n",
      "know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane\n",
      "are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear\n",
      "them, and each of them says something different. I don’t know which to\n",
      "follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is\n",
      "everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One\n",
      "evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have\n",
      "seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from\n",
      "her lover’s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of\n",
      "Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.\n",
      "She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and\n",
      "given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been\n",
      "innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike\n",
      "throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary\n",
      "women never appeal to one’s imagination. They are limited to their\n",
      "century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as\n",
      "easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is\n",
      "no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and\n",
      "chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped\n",
      "smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an\n",
      "actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn’t you tell me\n",
      "that the only thing worth loving is an actress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary\n",
      "charm in them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life\n",
      "you will tell me everything you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.\n",
      "You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would\n",
      "come and confess it to you. You would understand me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don’t commit crimes,\n",
      "Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now\n",
      "tell me—reach me the matches, like a good boy—thanks—what are your\n",
      "actual relations with Sibyl Vane?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.\n",
      "“Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said\n",
      "Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. “But why\n",
      "should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When\n",
      "one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one\n",
      "always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a\n",
      "romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the\n",
      "horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and\n",
      "offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was\n",
      "furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds\n",
      "of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I\n",
      "think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the\n",
      "impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not surprised.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I\n",
      "never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and\n",
      "confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy\n",
      "against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other\n",
      "hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all\n",
      "expensive.”\n",

      "have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good\n",
      "artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly\n",
      "uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is\n",
      "the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely\n",
      "fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they\n",
      "look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets\n",

      "him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by\n",

      "by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of\n",
      "that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had\n",
      "begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.\n",
      "Human life—that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.\n",
      "Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as\n",
      "one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one\n",
      "could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous\n",
      "fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with\n",
      "monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle\n",

      "logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect—to\n",
      "observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they\n",
      "were in unison, and at what point they were at discord—there was a\n",
      "delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too\n",
      "high a price for any sensation.\n",

      "to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent\n",
      "the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was\n",
      "something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its\n",
      "secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were\n",
      "revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect\n",
      "of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately\n",
      "with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex\n",
      "personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,\n",
      "in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,\n",
      "just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was\n",
      "yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was\n",
      "becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his\n",
      "beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It\n",
      "was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one\n",
      "of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be\n",
      "remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and\n",
      "whose wounds are like red roses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soul and body, body and soul—how mysterious they were! There was\n",
      "animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.\n",
      "The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say\n",
      "where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How\n",
      "shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And\n",
      "yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!\n",
      "Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body\n",
      "really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit\n",
      "from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a\n",
      "mystery also.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a\n",
      "science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it\n",
      "was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.\n",
      "Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to\n",
      "their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of\n",
      "warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation\n",
      "of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow\n",
      "and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in\n",
      "experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.\n",
      "All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same\n",
      "as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we\n",
      "would do many times, and with joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by\n",
      "which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and\n",
      "certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to\n",
      "promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane\n",
      "was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt\n",
      "that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new\n",
      "experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex\n",
      "passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of\n",
      "boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,\n",
      "changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from\n",
      "sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the\n",
      "passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most\n",
      "strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we\n",
      "were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were\n",

      "smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The\n",

      "\n",

      "to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don’t suppose I shall ever see\n",
      "this horrid London again. I am sure I don’t want to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up\n",
      "a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She\n",
      "felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would\n",
      "have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not, Mother? I mean it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a\n",
      "position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the\n",
      "Colonies—nothing that I would call society—so when you have made your\n",
      "fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Society!” muttered the lad. “I don’t want to know anything about that.\n",
      "I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I\n",
      "hate it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Jim!” said Sibyl, laughing, “how unkind of you! But are you really\n",
      "going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were\n",
      "going to say good-bye to some of your friends—to Tom Hardy, who gave\n",
      "you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking\n",
      "it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where\n",
      "shall we go? Let us go to the park.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am too shabby,” he answered, frowning. “Only swell people go to the\n",
      "park.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense, Jim,” she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated for a moment. “Very well,” he said at last, “but don’t be\n",
      "too long dressing.” She danced out of the door. One could hear her\n",
      "singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to\n",
      "the still figure in the chair. “Mother, are my things ready?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For\n",
      "some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this\n",
      "rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when\n",
      "their eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The\n",
      "silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.\n",
      "She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as\n",
      "they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. “I hope you will be\n",
      "contented, James, with your sea-faring life,” she said. “You must\n",
      "remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a\n",
      "solicitor’s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the\n",
      "country often dine with the best families.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied. “But you are quite\n",
      "right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don’t\n",
      "let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to\n",
      "talk to her. Is that right? What about that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James. In the\n",
      "profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying\n",
      "attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was\n",
      "when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at\n",
      "present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt\n",
      "that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always\n",
      "most polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and\n",
      "the flowers he sends are lovely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. “He has\n",
      "not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He\n",
      "is probably a member of the aristocracy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "James Vane bit his lip. “Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried, “watch\n",
      "over her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special\n",
      "care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why\n",
      "she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the\n",
      "aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a\n",
      "most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.\n",
      "His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane\n",
      "with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when\n",
      "the door opened and Sibyl ran in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How serious you both are!” she cried. “What is the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” he answered. “I suppose one must be serious sometimes.\n",
      "Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock. Everything is\n",
      "packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and\n",
      "there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kiss me, Mother,” said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the\n",
      "withered cheek and warmed its frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child! my child!” cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in\n",
      "search of an imaginary gallery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Sibyl,” said her brother impatiently. He hated his mother’s\n",
      "affectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled\n",
      "down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the\n",
      "sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the\n",
      "company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He was like a common\n",
      "gardener walking with a rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of\n",
      "some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on\n",
      "geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however,\n",
      "was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was\n",
      "trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming,\n",
      "and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,\n",
      "but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about\n",
      "the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life\n",
      "he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not\n",
      "to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.\n",
      "Oh, no! A sailor’s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a\n",
      "horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a\n",
      "black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long\n",
      "screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a\n",
      "polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.\n",
      "Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure\n",
      "gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it\n",
      "down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The\n",
      "bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with\n",
      "immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.\n",
      "They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other\n",
      "in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,\n",
      "and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful\n",
      "heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase,\n",
      "and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with\n",
      "her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense\n",
      "house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.\n",
      "But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money\n",
      "foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much\n",
      "more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and\n",
      "to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very\n",
      "good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a\n",
      "few years he would come back quite rich and happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick\n",
      "at leaving home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.\n",
      "Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger\n",
      "of Sibyl’s position. This young dandy who was making love to her could\n",
      "mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated\n",
      "him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,\n",
      "and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was\n",
      "conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother’s nature,\n",
      "and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl’s happiness.\n",
      "Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge\n",
      "them; sometimes they forgive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that\n",
      "he had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he\n",
      "had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears\n",
      "one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of\n",
      "horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a\n",
      "hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge-like\n",
      "furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl, “and I\n",
      "am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you want me to say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered,\n",
      "smiling at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shrugged his shoulders. “You are more likely to forget me than I am\n",
      "to forget you, Sibyl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She flushed. “What do you mean, Jim?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me\n",
      "about him? He means you no good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “You must not say anything against him. I\n",
      "love him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad. “Who is he? I\n",
      "have a right to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is called Prince Charming. Don’t you like the name. Oh! you silly\n",
      "boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think\n",
      "him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet\n",
      "him—when you come back from Australia. You will like him so much.\n",
      "Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the\n",
      "theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh!\n",
      "how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have\n",
      "him sitting there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten\n",
      "the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass\n",
      "one’s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ‘genius’ to his\n",
      "loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will\n",
      "announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only,\n",
      "Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor\n",
      "beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the\n",
      "door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.\n",
      "They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I\n",
      "think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A prince!” she cried musically. “What more do you want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He wants to enslave you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shudder at the thought of being free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want you to beware of him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sibyl, you are mad about him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed and took his arm. “You dear old Jim, you talk as if you\n",
      "were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will\n",
      "know what it is. Don’t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to\n",
      "think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have\n",
      "ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and\n",
      "difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world,\n",
      "and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the\n",
      "smart people go by.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across\n",
      "the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust—tremulous\n",
      "cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air. The brightly\n",
      "coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He\n",
      "spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as\n",
      "players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not\n",
      "communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all\n",
      "the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she\n",
      "caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open\n",
      "carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.\n",
      "\n",
      "She started to her feet. “There he is!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who?” said Jim Vane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Prince Charming,” she answered, looking after the victoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. “Show him to me. Which\n",
      "is he? Point him out. I must see him!” he exclaimed; but at that moment\n",
      "the Duke of Berwick’s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left\n",
      "the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is gone,” murmured Sibyl sadly. “I wish you had seen him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does\n",
      "you any wrong, I shall kill him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air\n",
      "like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to\n",
      "her tittered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come away, Jim; come away,” she whispered. He followed her doggedly as\n",
      "she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity\n",
      "in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at\n",
      "him. “You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that\n",
      "is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don’t know what you\n",
      "are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you\n",
      "would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said was\n",
      "wicked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sixteen,” he answered, “and I know what I am about. Mother is no\n",
      "help to you. She doesn’t understand how to look after you. I wish now\n",
      "that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck\n",
      "the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn’t been signed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those\n",
      "silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going\n",
      "to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect\n",
      "happiness. We won’t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I\n",
      "love, would you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not as long as you love him, I suppose,” was the sullen answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall love him for ever!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For ever, too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He had better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He\n",
      "was merely a boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to\n",
      "their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o’clock, and\n",
      "Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted\n",
      "that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with her when\n",
      "their mother was not present. She would be sure to make a scene, and he\n",
      "detested scenes of every kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Sybil’s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad’s heart,\n",
      "and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,\n",
      "had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck,\n",
      "and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her\n",
      "with real affection. There were tears in his eyes as he went\n",
      "downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his\n",
      "unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his\n",
      "meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the\n",
      "stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of\n",
      "street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that\n",
      "was left to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his\n",
      "hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to\n",
      "him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother\n",
      "watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace\n",
      "handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got\n",
      "up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their\n",
      "eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said. Her eyes wandered\n",
      "vaguely about the room. She made no answer. “Tell me the truth. I have\n",
      "a right to know. Were you married to my father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,\n",
      "the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,\n",
      "had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure\n",
      "it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question\n",
      "called for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led up\n",
      "to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father was a scoundrel then!” cried the lad, clenching his fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shook her head. “I knew he was not free. We loved each other very\n",
      "much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don’t speak\n",
      "against him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he\n",
      "was highly connected.”\n",
      "\n",
      "An oath broke from his lips. “I don’t care for myself,” he exclaimed,\n",
      "“but don’t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn’t it, who is in love\n",
      "with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her\n",
      "head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. “Sibyl has a\n",
      "mother,” she murmured; “I had none.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed\n",
      "her. “I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,” he\n",
      "said, “but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don’t forget\n",
      "that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me\n",
      "that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him\n",
      "down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that\n",
      "accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid\n",
      "to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely,\n",
      "and for the first time for many months she really admired her son. She\n",
      "would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional\n",
      "scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers\n",
      "looked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the\n",
      "bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It\n",
      "was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the\n",
      "tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She\n",
      "was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled\n",
      "herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now\n",
      "that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase.\n",
      "It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and\n",

      "“I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry that\n",
      "evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol\n",
      "where dinner had been laid for three.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Harry,” answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing\n",
      "waiter. “What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don’t\n",
      "interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons\n",
      "worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little\n",
      "whitewashing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching him\n",
      "as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward started and then frowned. “Dorian engaged to be married!” he\n",
      "cried. “Impossible!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is perfectly true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To whom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To some little actress or other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear\n",
      "Basil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Except in America,” rejoined Lord Henry languidly. “But I didn’t say\n",
      "he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great\n",
      "difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have\n",
      "no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I\n",
      "never was engaged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be\n",
      "absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is\n",
      "sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it\n",
      "is always from the noblest motives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don’t want to see Dorian tied to\n",
      "some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his\n",
      "intellect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, she is better than good—she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry,\n",
      "sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. “Dorian says she is\n",
      "beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your\n",
      "portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal\n",
      "appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst\n",
      "others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his\n",
      "appointment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you serious?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever\n",
      "be more serious than I am at the present moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up and\n",
      "down the room and biting his lip. “You can’t approve of it, possibly.\n",
      "It is some silly infatuation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd\n",
      "attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air\n",
      "our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people\n",
      "say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a\n",
      "personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality\n",
      "selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with\n",
      "a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not?\n",
      "If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know\n",
      "I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that\n",
      "it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack\n",
      "individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage\n",
      "makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other\n",
      "egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more\n",
      "highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the\n",
      "object of man’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and\n",
      "whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I\n",
      "hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore\n",
      "her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one\n",
      "else. He would be a wonderful study.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don’t.\n",
      "If Dorian Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than\n",
      "yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry laughed. “The reason we all like to think so well of others\n",
      "is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer\n",
      "terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour\n",
      "with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to\n",
      "us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find\n",
      "good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our\n",
      "pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest\n",
      "contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but\n",
      "one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have\n",
      "merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,\n",
      "but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I\n",
      "will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being\n",
      "fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I\n",
      "can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said the\n",
      "lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and\n",
      "shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. “I have never been so\n",
      "happy. Of course, it is sudden—all really delightful things are. And\n",
      "yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my\n",
      "life.” He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked\n",
      "extraordinarily handsome.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward, “but I\n",
      "don’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.\n",
      "You let Harry know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord\n",
      "Henry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.\n",
      "“Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and\n",
      "then you will tell us how it all came about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their\n",
      "seats at the small round table. “What happened was simply this. After I\n",
      "left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that\n",
      "little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and\n",
      "went down at eight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.\n",
      "Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!\n",
      "You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she\n",
      "was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with\n",
      "cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little\n",
      "green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak\n",
      "lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had\n",
      "all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your\n",
      "studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round\n",
      "a pale rose. As for her acting—well, you shall see her to-night. She is\n",
      "simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I\n",
      "forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away\n",
      "with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the\n",
      "performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were\n",
      "sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had\n",
      "never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each\n",
      "other. I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to\n",
      "me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of\n",
      "rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white\n",
      "narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I\n",
      "feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of\n",
      "course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own\n",
      "mother. I don’t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to\n",
      "be furious. I don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and\n",
      "then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take\n",
      "my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips\n",
      "that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.\n",
      "I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the\n",
      "mouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray shook his head. “I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall\n",
      "find her in an orchard in Verona.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. “At what\n",
      "particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what\n",
      "did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did\n",
      "not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said\n",
      "she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is\n",
      "nothing to me compared with her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much more\n",
      "practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to\n",
      "say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. “Don’t, Harry. You have annoyed\n",
      "Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any\n",
      "one. His nature is too fine for that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry looked across the table. “Dorian is never annoyed with me,”\n",
      "he answered. “I asked the question for the best reason possible, for\n",
      "the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any\n",
      "question—simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women\n",
      "who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of\n",
      "course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not\n",
      "modern.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. “You are quite incorrigible,\n",
      "Harry; but I don’t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When\n",
      "you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her\n",
      "would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any\n",
      "one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to\n",
      "place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman\n",
      "who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for\n",
      "that. Ah! don’t mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her\n",
      "trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her,\n",
      "I regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you\n",
      "have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane’s\n",
      "hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous,\n",
      "delightful theories.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories\n",
      "about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he answered\n",
      "in his slow melodious voice. “But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory\n",
      "as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature’s test,\n",
      "her sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when\n",
      "we are good, we are not always happy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord\n",
      "Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the\n",
      "centre of the table, “what do you mean by good, Harry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied, touching\n",
      "the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.\n",
      "“Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own\n",
      "life—that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s neighbours,\n",
      "if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral\n",
      "views about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides,\n",
      "individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in\n",
      "accepting the standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of\n",
      "culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest\n",
      "immorality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, surely, if one lives merely for one’s self, Harry, one pays a\n",
      "terrible price for doing so?” suggested the painter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that\n",
      "the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but\n",
      "self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege\n",
      "of the rich.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One has to pay in other ways but money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sort of ways, Basil?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the\n",
      "consciousness of degradation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, mediæval art is\n",
      "charming, but mediæval emotions are out of date. One can use them in\n",
      "fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in\n",
      "fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,\n",
      "no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever\n",
      "knows what a pleasure is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray. “It is to adore some\n",
      "one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying with\n",
      "some fruits. “Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as\n",
      "humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us\n",
      "to do something for them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to\n",
      "us,” murmured the lad gravely. “They create love in our natures. They\n",
      "have a right to demand it back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is,” interrupted Dorian. “You must admit, Harry, that women give\n",
      "to men the very gold of their lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in such very\n",
      "small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once\n",
      "put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always\n",
      "prevent us from carrying them out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry, you are dreadful! I don’t know why I like you so much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied. “Will you have some\n",
      "coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and\n",
      "some cigarettes. No, don’t mind the cigarettes—I have some. Basil, I\n",
      "can’t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette\n",
      "is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it\n",
      "leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will\n",
      "always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never\n",
      "had the courage to commit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried the lad, taking a light from a\n",
      "fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.\n",
      "“Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will\n",
      "have a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you\n",
      "have never known.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his\n",
      "eyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,\n",
      "that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful\n",
      "girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life.\n",
      "Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but\n",
      "there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a\n",
      "hansom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The\n",
      "painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He\n",
      "could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better\n",
      "than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,\n",
      "they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been\n",
      "arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in\n",
      "front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that\n",
      "Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the\n",
      "past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded\n",
      "flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the\n",

      "\n",
      "For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat\n",
      "Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with\n",
      "an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of\n",
      "pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top\n",
      "of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he\n",
      "had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,\n",
      "upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and\n",
      "insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud\n",
      "to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a\n",
      "poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The\n",
      "heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a\n",
      "monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery\n",
      "had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.\n",
      "They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges\n",
      "with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in\n",
      "the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of\n",
      "the popping of corks came from the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray. “It was here I found her, and she is\n",
      "divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget\n",
      "everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and\n",
      "brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They\n",
      "sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to\n",
      "do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them,\n",
      "and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one’s self.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The same flesh and blood as one’s self! Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed\n",

      "must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must\n",
      "be fine and noble. To spiritualize one’s age—that is something worth\n",
      "doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without\n",

      "all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage\n",

      "is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about\n",

      "A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of\n",
      "applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly\n",
      "lovely to look at—one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,\n",
      "that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace\n",
      "and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror\n",
      "of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded\n",
      "enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to\n",

      "the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a\n",
      "creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a\n",
      "plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a\n",
      "white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.\n",

      "Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\n",

      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.\n",
      "Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them\n",

      "\n",
      "Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of\n",

      "\n",
      "She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be\n",
      "denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse\n",

      "\n",

      "I have no joy of this contract to-night:\n",

      "\n",
      "Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their\n",
      "interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and\n",

      "\n",
      "“I wish she were ill,” he rejoined. “But she seems to me to be simply\n",

      "artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more\n",

      "\n",
      "“They are both simply forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry. “But do\n",
      "let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good\n",
      "for one’s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don’t suppose you will\n",
      "want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like\n",
      "a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about\n",
      "life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.\n",
      "There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating—people\n",
      "who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.\n",
      "Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so tragic! The secret of\n",
      "remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to\n",
      "the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to\n",

      "\n",
      "“Go away, Harry,” cried the lad. “I want to be alone. Basil, you must\n",
      "go. Ah! can’t you see that my heart is breaking?” The hot tears came to\n",
      "his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he\n",
      "leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his\n",

      "\n",
      "A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose\n",
      "on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale,\n",
      "and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed\n",
      "interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots\n",
      "and laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played\n",
      "to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some\n",
      "groans.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the\n",
      "greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on\n",
      "her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a\n",
      "radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of\n",
      "their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy\n",
      "came over her. “How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement. “Horribly! It was\n",
      "dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea\n",
      "what I suffered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl smiled. “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name with\n",
      "long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to\n",
      "the red petals of her mouth. “Dorian, you should have understood. But\n",
      "you understand now, don’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall\n",

      "\n",
      "He shrugged his shoulders. “You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill\n",
      "you shouldn’t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored.\n",
      "I was bored.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An\n",
      "ecstasy of happiness dominated her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one\n",
      "reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought\n",
      "that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.\n",
      "The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine\n",
      "also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me\n",
      "seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew\n",
      "nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came—oh, my beautiful\n",
      "love!—and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality\n",
      "really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the\n",
      "hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had\n",
      "always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that\n",
      "the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the\n",
      "orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I\n",
      "had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to\n",
      "say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is\n",
      "but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My\n",
      "love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of\n",
      "shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do\n",
      "with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not\n",
      "understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that\n",
      "I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly\n",
      "it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to\n",
      "me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love\n",
      "such as ours? Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can\n",
      "be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not\n",
      "feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,\n",
      "Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it\n",
      "would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me\n",
      "see that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. “You have\n",
      "killed my love,” he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came\n",
      "across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt\n",
      "down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a\n",
      "shudder ran through him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he leaped up and went to the door. “Yes,” he cried, “you have\n",
      "killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don’t even\n",
      "stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because\n",
      "you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you\n",
      "realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the\n",
      "shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and\n",
      "stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You\n",
      "are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think\n",
      "of you. I will never mention your name. You don’t know what you were to\n",
      "me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! I wish I had\n",
      "never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How\n",
      "little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your\n",
      "art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid,\n",
      "magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have\n",
      "borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty\n",
      "face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and\n",
      "her voice seemed to catch in her throat. “You are not serious, Dorian?”\n",
      "she murmured. “You are acting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,” he answered bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her\n",
      "face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and\n",
      "looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. “Don’t touch me!” he cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay\n",
      "there like a trampled flower. “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she\n",
      "whispered. “I am so sorry I didn’t act well. I was thinking of you all\n",
      "the time. But I will try—indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across\n",
      "me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had\n",
      "not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.\n",
      "Don’t go away from me. I couldn’t bear it. Oh! don’t go away from me.\n",
      "My brother ... No; never mind. He didn’t mean it. He was in jest....\n",
      "But you, oh! can’t you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and\n",
      "try to improve. Don’t be cruel to me, because I love you better than\n",
      "anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not\n",
      "pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown\n",
      "myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn’t help\n",
      "it. Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.” A fit of passionate sobbing\n",
      "choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian\n",
      "Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled\n",
      "lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous\n",
      "about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane\n",
      "seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice. “I don’t wish to\n",
      "be unkind, but I can’t see you again. You have disappointed me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little\n",
      "hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He\n",
      "turned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of\n",
      "the theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly\n",
      "lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking\n",
      "houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after\n",
      "him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like\n",
      "monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps,\n",
      "and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.\n",
      "The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed\n",
      "itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies\n",
      "rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with\n",
      "the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an\n",
      "anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men\n",
      "unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some\n",
      "cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money\n",
      "for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at\n",
      "midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long\n",
      "line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red\n",
      "roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,\n",
      "jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,\n",
      "sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,\n",
      "waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging\n",
      "doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped\n",
      "and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.\n",
      "Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked\n",
      "and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few\n",
      "moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent\n",
      "square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.\n",
      "The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like\n",
      "silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke\n",
      "was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that\n",
      "hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,\n",
      "lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals\n",
      "of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and,\n",
      "having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library\n",
      "towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the\n",
      "ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had\n",
      "decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries\n",
      "that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As\n",
      "he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait\n",
      "Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.\n",
      "Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he\n",
      "had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.\n",
      "Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In\n",
      "the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk\n",
      "blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression\n",
      "looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty\n",
      "in the mouth. It was certainly strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The\n",
      "bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky\n",
      "corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he\n",
      "had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be\n",
      "more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the\n",
      "lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking\n",
      "into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory\n",
      "Cupids, one of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly\n",
      "into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What\n",
      "did it mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it\n",
      "again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual\n",
      "painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had\n",
      "altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly\n",
      "apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there\n",
      "flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the\n",
      "day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He\n",
      "had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the\n",
      "portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the\n",
      "face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that\n",
      "the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and\n",
      "thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness\n",
      "of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been\n",
      "fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to\n",
      "think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the\n",
      "touch of cruelty in the mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had\n",
      "dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he\n",
      "had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been\n",
      "shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over\n",
      "him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little\n",
      "child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had\n",
      "he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he\n",
      "had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had\n",
      "lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His\n",
      "life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had\n",
      "wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear\n",
      "sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of\n",
      "their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one\n",
      "with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and\n",
      "Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl\n",
      "Vane? She was nothing to him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his\n",
      "life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.\n",
      "Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it\n",
      "again?\n",
      "\n",
      "No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The\n",
      "horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly\n",
      "there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men\n",
      "mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel\n",
      "smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met\n",
      "his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted\n",
      "image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would\n",
      "alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses\n",
      "would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and\n",
      "wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or\n",
      "unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would\n",
      "resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more—would not, at\n",
      "any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil\n",
      "Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for\n",
      "impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,\n",
      "marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She\n",
      "must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish\n",
      "and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would\n",
      "return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be\n",
      "beautiful and pure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the\n",
      "portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. “How horrible!” he murmured\n",
      "to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he\n",
      "stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning\n",
      "air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of\n",
      "Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name\n",
      "over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times\n",
      "on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered\n",
      "what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and\n",
      "Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a\n",
      "small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains,\n",
      "with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall\n",
      "windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his\n",
      "letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand\n",
      "that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The\n",
      "others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of\n",
      "cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of\n",
      "charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young\n",
      "men every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for\n",
      "a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the\n",
      "courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned\n",
      "people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary\n",
      "things are our only necessities; and there were several very\n",
      "courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders\n",
      "offering to advance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the\n",
      "most reasonable rates of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate\n",
      "dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the\n",
      "onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.\n",
      "He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense\n",
      "of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice,\n",
      "but there was the unreality of a dream about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a\n",
      "light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round\n",
      "table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air\n",
      "seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the\n",
      "blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before\n",
      "him. He felt perfectly happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the\n",
      "portrait, and he started.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on the\n",
      "table. “I shut the window?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian shook his head. “I am not cold,” he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply\n",
      "his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there\n",
      "had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The\n",
      "thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It\n",
      "would make him smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in\n",
      "the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of\n",
      "cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the\n",
      "room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the\n",
      "portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes\n",
      "had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to\n",
      "tell him to remain. As the door was closing behind him, he called him\n",
      "back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a\n",
      "moment. “I am not at home to any one, Victor,” he said with a sigh. The\n",
      "man bowed and retired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on\n",
      "a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen\n",
      "was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a\n",
      "rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously,\n",
      "wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man’s life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was\n",
      "the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was\n",
      "not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier\n",
      "chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?\n",
      "What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own\n",
      "picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be\n",
      "examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful\n",
      "state of doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he\n",
      "looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and\n",
      "saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had\n",
      "altered.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he\n",
      "found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost\n",
      "scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was\n",
      "incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle\n",
      "affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form\n",
      "and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be\n",
      "that what that soul thought, they realized?—that what it dreamed, they\n",
      "made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered,\n",
      "and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the\n",
      "picture in sickened horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him\n",
      "conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not\n",
      "too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His\n",
      "unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be\n",
      "transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil\n",
      "Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would\n",
      "be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the\n",
      "fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could\n",
      "lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the\n",
      "degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men\n",
      "brought upon their souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three o’clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double\n",
      "chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the\n",
      "scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his\n",
      "way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was\n",
      "wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he\n",
      "went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had\n",
      "loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He\n",
      "covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of\n",
      "pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we\n",
      "feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,\n",
      "not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the\n",
      "letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s\n",
      "voice outside. “My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can’t\n",
      "bear your shutting yourself up like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking\n",
      "still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry\n",
      "in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel\n",
      "with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was\n",
      "inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,\n",
      "and unlocked the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered. “But\n",
      "you must not think too much about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly\n",
      "pulling off his yellow gloves. “It is dreadful, from one point of view,\n",
      "but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her,\n",
      "after the play was over?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was brutal, Harry—perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am\n",
      "not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know\n",
      "myself better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would\n",
      "find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and\n",
      "smiling. “I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin\n",
      "with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in\n",
      "us. Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before me. I want\n",
      "to be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you\n",
      "on it. But how are you going to begin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him\n",
      "in perplexed amazement. “But, my dear Dorian—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about\n",
      "marriage. Don’t say it. Don’t ever say things of that kind to me again.\n",
      "Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word\n",
      "to her. She is to be my wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn’t you get my letter? I wrote to you this\n",
      "morning, and sent the note down by my own man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was\n",
      "afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like. You cut\n",
      "life to pieces with your epigrams.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know nothing then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,\n",
      "took both his hands in his own and held them tightly. “Dorian,” he\n",
      "said, “my letter—don’t be frightened—was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is\n",
      "dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A cry of pain broke from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet,\n",
      "tearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp. “Dead! Sibyl dead! It\n",
      "is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely. “It is in all the\n",
      "morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till\n",
      "I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not\n",
      "be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.\n",
      "But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make\n",
      "one’s _début_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an\n",
      "interest to one’s old age. I suppose they don’t know your name at the\n",
      "theatre? If they don’t, it is all right. Did any one see you going\n",
      "round to her room? That is an important point.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.\n",
      "Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an\n",
      "inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl—? Oh, Harry, I can’t bear\n",
      "it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put\n",
      "in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre\n",
      "with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had\n",
      "forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she\n",
      "did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the\n",
      "floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake,\n",
      "some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don’t know what it was, but\n",
      "it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was\n",
      "prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry, Harry, it is terrible!” cried the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed\n",
      "up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have\n",
      "thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and\n",
      "seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn’t let this\n",
      "thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and\n",
      "afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and\n",
      "everybody will be there. You can come to my sister’s box. She has got\n",
      "some smart women with her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself,\n",
      "“murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.\n",
      "Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as\n",
      "happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go\n",
      "on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How\n",
      "extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,\n",
      "Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has\n",
      "happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.\n",
      "Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my\n",
      "life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been\n",
      "addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent\n",
      "people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh,\n",
      "Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was\n",
      "everything to me. Then came that dreadful night—was it really only last\n",
      "night?—when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She\n",
      "explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a\n",
      "bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me\n",
      "afraid. I can’t tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I\n",
      "would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My\n",
      "God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don’t know the danger I am in,\n",
      "and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for\n",
      "me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case\n",
      "and producing a gold-latten matchbox, “the only way a woman can ever\n",
      "reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible\n",
      "interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been\n",
      "wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always\n",
      "be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon\n",
      "found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman\n",
      "finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy,\n",
      "or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay\n",
      "for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been\n",
      "abject—which, of course, I would not have allowed—but I assure you that\n",
      "in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room\n",
      "and looking horribly pale. “But I thought it was my duty. It is not my\n",
      "fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.\n",
      "I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good\n",
      "resolutions—that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific\n",
      "laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.\n",
      "They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions\n",
      "that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said\n",
      "for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they\n",
      "have no account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,\n",
      "“why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I\n",
      "don’t think I am heartless. Do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be\n",
      "entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with\n",
      "his sweet melancholy smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lad frowned. “I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he rejoined,\n",
      "“but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless. I am nothing of the\n",
      "kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has\n",
      "happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply\n",
      "like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible\n",
      "beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but\n",
      "by which I have not been wounded.”\n",

      "pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have\n",
      "all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame:\n",

      "\n",

      "of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips\n",
      "that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat\n",
      "before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as\n",

      "hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had\n",
      "so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The\n",
      "pity of it! the pity of it!\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that\n",
      "existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in\n",
      "answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain\n",
      "unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender\n",
      "the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance\n",
      "might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?\n",
      "Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer\n",
      "that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious\n",
      "scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence\n",
      "upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon\n",
      "dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,\n",
      "might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods\n",
      "and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?\n",
      "But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a\n",

      "alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?\n",
      "\n",
      "For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to\n",
      "follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him\n",
      "the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so\n",
      "it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he\n",
      "would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.\n",
      "When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of\n",
      "chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one\n",
      "blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life\n",
      "would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and\n",

      "gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy\n",

      "when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late\n",

      "The elder man buried his face in his hands. “How fearful,” he muttered,\n",
      "and a shudder ran through him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Dorian Gray, “there is nothing fearful about it. It is one\n",
      "of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act\n",
      "lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful\n",
      "wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean—middle-class virtue\n",
      "and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her\n",
      "finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played—the\n",
      "night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of\n",
      "love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.\n",
      "She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the\n",
      "martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of\n",
      "martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not\n",
      "think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular\n",
      "moment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would\n",
      "have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the\n",
      "news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered\n",
      "immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can,\n",
      "except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come\n",
      "down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled,\n",
      "and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a\n",
      "story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty\n",
      "years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some\n",
      "unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded,\n",
      "and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing\n",
      "to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And\n",
      "besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me\n",
      "rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic\n",
      "point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la\n",
      "consolation des arts_? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered\n",
      "book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.\n",

      "or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of\n",
      "one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I\n",
      "know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not\n",
      "realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am\n",
      "a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am\n",
      "different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must\n",
      "always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know\n",
      "that you are better than he is. You are not stronger—you are too much\n",
      "afraid of life—but you are better. And how happy we used to be\n",
      "together! Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t quarrel with me. I am what I\n",
      "am. There is nothing more to be said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him,\n",
      "and his personality had been the great turning point in his art. He\n",
      "could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his\n",
      "indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was\n",
      "so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Dorian,” he said at length, with a sad smile, “I won’t speak to\n",
      "you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your\n",
      "name won’t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take\n",
      "place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at\n",
      "the mention of the word “inquest.” There was something so crude and\n",
      "vulgar about everything of the kind. “They don’t know my name,” he\n",
      "answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But surely she did?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned\n",
      "to any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn\n",
      "who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince\n",
      "Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,\n",
      "Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a\n",
      "few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you\n",
      "must come and sit to me yourself again. I can’t get on without you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!” he exclaimed,\n",
      "starting back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter stared at him. “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried. “Do\n",
      "you mean to say you don’t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have\n",
      "you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best\n",
      "thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply\n",
      "disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room\n",
      "looked different as I came in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don’t imagine I let\n",
      "him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes—that\n",
      "is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for\n",
      "it. Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between\n",
      "the painter and the screen. “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you\n",
      "must not look at it. I don’t wish you to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn’t I look at\n",
      "it?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never\n",
      "speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don’t offer\n",
      "any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you\n",
      "touch this screen, everything is over between us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute\n",
      "amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually\n",
      "pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes\n",
      "were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t speak!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what is the matter? Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t want\n",
      "me to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over\n",
      "towards the window. “But, really, it seems rather absurd that I\n",
      "shouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in\n",
      "Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of\n",
      "varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a\n",
      "strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be\n",
      "shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That\n",
      "was impossible. Something—he did not know what—had to be done at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going\n",
      "to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de\n",
      "Sèze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only\n",
      "be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that\n",
      "time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it\n",
      "always behind a screen, you can’t care much about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of\n",
      "perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible\n",
      "danger. “You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he\n",
      "cried. “Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being\n",
      "consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference\n",
      "is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can’t have forgotten\n",
      "that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would\n",
      "induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the\n",
      "same thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his\n",
      "eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half\n",
      "seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter of\n",
      "an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture. He\n",
      "told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Yes, perhaps\n",
      "Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in\n",
      "the face, “we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall\n",
      "tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my\n",
      "picture?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The painter shuddered in spite of himself. “Dorian, if I told you, you\n",
      "might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I\n",
      "could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me\n",
      "never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to\n",
      "look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from\n",
      "the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any\n",
      "fame or reputation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray. “I think I have a\n",
      "right to know.” His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity\n",
      "had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward’s\n",
      "mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled. “Let us\n",
      "sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the\n",
      "picture something curious?—something that probably at first did not\n",
      "strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling\n",
      "hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.\n",
      "Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most\n",
      "extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and\n",
      "power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen\n",
      "ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I\n",
      "worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted\n",
      "to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When\n",
      "you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course,\n",
      "I never let you know anything about this. It would have been\n",
      "impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it\n",
      "myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that\n",
      "the world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for\n",
      "in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less\n",
      "than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew\n",
      "more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn\n",
      "you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and\n",
      "polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on\n",
      "the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You\n",
      "had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the\n",
      "water’s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been\n",
      "what art should be—unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day\n",
      "I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as\n",
      "you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own\n",
      "dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method,\n",
      "or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to\n",
      "me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at\n",
      "it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I\n",
      "grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that\n",
      "I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it\n",
      "was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You\n",
      "were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant\n",
      "to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not\n",
      "mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I\n",
      "felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my\n",
      "studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of\n",
      "its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that\n",
      "I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely\n",
      "good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling\n",
      "that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is\n",
      "ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract\n",
      "than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all.\n",
      "It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely\n",
      "than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I\n",
      "determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.\n",
      "It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were\n",
      "right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,\n",
      "Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are\n",
      "made to be worshipped.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and\n",
      "a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the\n",
      "time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who\n",
      "had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he\n",
      "himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord\n",
      "Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was\n",
      "too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be\n",
      "some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of\n",
      "the things that life had in store?\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you should\n",
      "have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw something in it,” he answered, “something that seemed to me very\n",
      "curious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you don’t mind my looking at the thing now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian shook his head. “You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not\n",
      "possibly let you stand in front of that picture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will some day, surely?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been\n",
      "the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I\n",
      "have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don’t know what it cost\n",
      "me to tell you all that I have told you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Basil,” said Dorian, “what have you told me? Simply that you\n",
      "felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I\n",
      "have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one\n",
      "should never put one’s worship into words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a very disappointing confession.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn’t see anything else in the\n",
      "picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn’t\n",
      "talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we\n",
      "must always remain so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have got Harry,” said the painter sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. “Harry spends\n",
      "his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is\n",
      "improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I\n",
      "don’t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go\n",
      "to you, Basil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will sit to me again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Impossible!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes\n",
      "across two ideal things. Few come across one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.\n",
      "There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I\n",
      "will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward regretfully. “And\n",
      "now good-bye. I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture once\n",
      "again. But that can’t be helped. I quite understand what you feel about\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How\n",
      "little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead\n",
      "of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded,\n",
      "almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that\n",
      "strange confession explained to him! The painter’s absurd fits of\n",
      "jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious\n",
      "reticences—he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed\n",
      "to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all\n",
      "costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad\n",
      "of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room\n",
      "to which any of his friends had access.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if\n",
      "he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite\n",
      "impassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked\n",
      "over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of\n",
      "Victor’s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There\n",
      "was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his\n",
      "guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he\n",
      "wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to\n",
      "send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man\n",
      "left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was\n",
      "that merely his own fancy?\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread\n",
      "mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He\n",
      "asked her for the key of the schoolroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it is full of\n",
      "dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It\n",
      "is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it\n",
      "hasn’t been opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship died.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of\n",
      "him. “That does not matter,” he answered. “I simply want to see the\n",
      "place—that is all. Give me the key.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the contents\n",
      "of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. “Here is the key. I’ll\n",
      "have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don’t think of living up\n",
      "there, sir, and you so comfortable here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” he cried petulantly. “Thank you, Leaf. That will do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of\n",
      "the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought\n",
      "best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round\n",
      "the room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily\n",
      "embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century\n",
      "Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.\n",
      "Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps\n",
      "served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that\n",
      "had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death\n",
      "itself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What\n",
      "the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on\n",
      "the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They\n",
      "would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still\n",
      "live on. It would be always alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil\n",
      "the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would\n",
      "have helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the still more\n",
      "poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that\n",
      "he bore him—for it was really love—had nothing in it that was not noble\n",
      "and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty\n",
      "that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was\n",
      "such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,\n",
      "and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was\n",
      "too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or\n",
      "forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were\n",
      "passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that\n",
      "would make the shadow of their evil real.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that\n",
      "covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was\n",
      "the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was\n",
      "unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue\n",
      "eyes, and rose-red lips—they all were there. It was simply the\n",
      "expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared\n",
      "to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil’s\n",
      "reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!—how shallow, and of what little\n",
      "account! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and\n",
      "calling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung\n",
      "the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door.\n",
      "He passed out as his servant entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The persons are here, Monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed\n",
      "to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly\n",
      "about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the\n",
      "writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him\n",
      "round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at\n",
      "eight-fifteen that evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men in\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard\n",
      "himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in\n",
      "with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a\n",
      "florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was\n",
      "considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the\n",
      "artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He\n",
      "waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in\n",
      "favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed\n",
      "everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled\n",
      "hands. “I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in\n",
      "person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a\n",
      "sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited\n",
      "for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.\n",
      "Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though I don’t\n",
      "go in much at present for religious art—but to-day I only want a\n",
      "picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so\n",
      "I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to\n",
      "you. Which is the work of art, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back. “Can you move it,\n",
      "covering and all, just as it is? I don’t want it to get scratched going\n",
      "upstairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker,\n",
      "beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from\n",
      "the long brass chains by which it was suspended. “And, now, where shall\n",
      "we carry it to, Mr. Gray?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or\n",
      "perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top\n",
      "of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and\n",
      "began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the\n",
      "picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious\n",
      "protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman’s spirited dislike\n",
      "of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it\n",
      "so as to help them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man when they\n",
      "reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid it is rather heavy,” murmured Dorian as he unlocked the\n",
      "door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious\n",
      "secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not entered the place for more than four years—not, indeed,\n",
      "since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then\n",
      "as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large,\n",
      "well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord\n",
      "Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness\n",
      "to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and\n",
      "desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little\n",
      "changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically\n",
      "painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so\n",
      "often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled\n",
      "with his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the\n",
      "same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing\n",
      "chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded\n",
      "birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every\n",
      "moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He\n",
      "recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed\n",
      "horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden\n",
      "away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in\n",
      "store for him!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as\n",
      "this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its\n",
      "purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,\n",
      "and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would\n",
      "not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He\n",
      "kept his youth—that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow\n",
      "finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full\n",
      "of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and\n",
      "shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit\n",
      "and in flesh—those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them\n",
      "their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would\n",
      "have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to\n",
      "the world Basil Hallward’s masterpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon\n",
      "the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but\n",
      "the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become\n",
      "hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow’s feet would creep round the fading eyes\n",
      "and make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth\n",
      "would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old\n",
      "men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined\n",
      "hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had\n",
      "been so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed.\n",
      "There was no help for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning round. “I\n",
      "am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who\n",
      "was still gasping for breath. “Where shall we put it, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don’t want to have it hung up.\n",
      "Just lean it against the wall. Thanks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian started. “It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said,\n",
      "keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling\n",
      "him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that\n",
      "concealed the secret of his life. “I shan’t trouble you any more now. I\n",
      "am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,\n",
      "sir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,\n",
      "who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough\n",
      "uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door\n",
      "and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look\n",
      "upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock\n",
      "and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark\n",
      "perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,\n",
      "his guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the\n",
      "preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside\n",
      "it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the\n",
      "edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. James’s Gazette_\n",
      "had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had\n",
      "returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were\n",
      "leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.\n",
      "He would be sure to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already,\n",
      "while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set\n",
      "back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he\n",
      "might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the\n",
      "room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house. He had\n",
      "heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some\n",
      "servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked\n",
      "up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower\n",
      "or a shred of crumpled lace.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry’s\n",
      "note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,\n",
      "and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at\n",
      "eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James’s_ languidly, and looked\n",
      "through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew\n",
      "attention to the following paragraph:\n",
      "\n",
      "INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.—An inquest was held this morning at the Bell\n",
      "Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of\n",
      "Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,\n",
      "Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable\n",
      "sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly\n",
      "affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.\n",
      "Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and\n",
      "flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real\n",
      "ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for\n",
      "having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have\n",
      "marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more\n",
      "than enough English for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,\n",
      "what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane’s death?\n",
      "There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was\n",
      "it, he wondered. He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal\n",
      "stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange\n",
      "Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung\n",
      "himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a\n",
      "few minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he had\n",
      "ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the\n",
      "delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb\n",
      "show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made\n",
      "real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually\n",
      "revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,\n",
      "indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who\n",
      "spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the\n",
      "passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his\n",
      "own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through\n",
      "which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere\n",
      "artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,\n",
      "as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The\n",
      "style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid\n",
      "and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical\n",
      "expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work\n",
      "of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.\n",
      "There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in\n",
      "colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical\n",
      "philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the\n",
      "spiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint or the morbid confessions of\n",
      "a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense\n",
      "seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere\n",
      "cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full\n",
      "as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,\n",
      "produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,\n",
      "a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of\n",
      "the falling day and creeping shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed\n",
      "through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no\n",
      "more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the\n",
      "lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed\n",
      "the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his\n",
      "bedside and began to dress for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found\n",
      "Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your\n",
      "fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the\n",
      "time was going.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his\n",
      "chair.\n",

      "great difference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, you have discovered that?” murmured Lord Henry. And they passed\n",

      "CHAPTER XI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of\n",
      "this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never\n",
      "sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than\n",
      "nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in\n",
      "different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the\n",
      "changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have\n",
      "almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in\n",
      "whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely\n",
      "blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,\n",
      "indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own\n",
      "life, written before he had lived it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one point he was more fortunate than the novel’s fantastic hero. He\n",
      "never knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that somewhat grotesque\n",
      "dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which\n",
      "came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned\n",
      "by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so\n",
      "remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every\n",
      "joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used\n",
      "to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if\n",
      "somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who\n",
      "had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly\n",
      "valued.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and\n",
      "many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had\n",
      "heard the most evil things against him—and from time to time strange\n",
      "rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the\n",
      "chatter of the clubs—could not believe anything to his dishonour when\n",
      "they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself\n",
      "unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when\n",
      "Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his\n",
      "face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the\n",
      "memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one\n",
      "so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an\n",
      "age that was at once sordid and sensual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged\n",
      "absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were\n",
      "his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep\n",
      "upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left\n",
      "him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil\n",
      "Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on\n",
      "the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him\n",
      "from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to\n",
      "quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his\n",
      "own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.\n",
      "He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and\n",
      "terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead\n",
      "or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which\n",
      "were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would\n",
      "place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,\n",
      "and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own\n",
      "delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little\n",
      "ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in\n",
      "disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he\n",
      "had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant\n",
      "because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.\n",
      "That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as\n",
      "they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase\n",
      "with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He\n",
      "had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to\n",
      "society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each\n",
      "Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the\n",
      "world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the\n",
      "day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little\n",
      "dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were\n",
      "noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,\n",
      "as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with\n",
      "its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered\n",
      "cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,\n",
      "especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,\n",
      "in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often\n",
      "dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of\n",
      "the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and\n",
      "perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of\n",
      "the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to “make\n",
      "themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.” Like Gautier, he was one\n",
      "for whom “the visible world existed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the\n",
      "arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.\n",
      "Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment\n",
      "universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert\n",
      "the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for\n",
      "him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to\n",
      "time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of\n",
      "the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in\n",
      "everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of\n",
      "his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost\n",
      "immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a\n",
      "subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the\n",
      "London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the\n",
      "Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be\n",

      "had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold\n",
      "brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with\n",
      "representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and\n",
      "embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of\n",
      "white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins\n",
      "and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen;\n",
      "and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices\n",
      "to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely\n",
      "house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he\n",
      "could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times\n",
      "to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked\n",
      "room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his\n",
      "own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the\n",
      "real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the\n",
      "purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there,\n",
      "would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,\n",
      "his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.\n",
      "Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to\n",
      "dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,\n",
      "until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the\n",
      "picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times,\n",
      "with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin,\n",
      "and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to\n",
      "bear the burden that should have been his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and\n",
      "gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as\n",
      "well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more\n",
      "than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the picture\n",
      "that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his\n",
      "absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the\n",
      "elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true\n",
      "that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness\n",
      "of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn\n",
      "from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not\n",
      "painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?\n",
      "Even if he told them, would they believe it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in\n",
      "Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank\n",
      "who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton\n",
      "luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly\n",
      "leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not\n",
      "been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it\n",
      "should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely\n",
      "the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already\n",
      "suspected it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.\n",
      "He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth\n",
      "and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was\n",
      "said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the\n",
      "smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another\n",
      "gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories\n",
      "became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It\n",
      "was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a\n",
      "low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with\n",
      "thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His\n",
      "extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear\n",
      "again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass\n",
      "him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though\n",
      "they were determined to discover his secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,\n",
      "and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his\n",
      "charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth\n",
      "that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer\n",
      "to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about\n",
      "him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most\n",
      "intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had\n",
      "wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and\n",
      "set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or\n",
      "horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his\n",
      "strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of\n",
      "security. Society—civilized society, at least—is never very ready to\n",
      "believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and\n",
      "fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance\n",
      "than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much\n",
      "less value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after all, it is\n",
      "a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad\n",
      "dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the\n",
      "cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrées_, as Lord Henry\n",
      "remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a\n",
      "good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are,\n",
      "or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely\n",
      "essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as\n",
      "its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic\n",
      "play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is\n",
      "insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method\n",
      "by which we can multiply our personalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the\n",
      "shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing\n",
      "simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a\n",
      "being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform\n",
      "creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and\n",
      "passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies\n",
      "of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery\n",
      "of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose\n",
      "blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by\n",
      "Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and\n",
      "King James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome\n",
      "face, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life\n",
      "that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body\n",
      "to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that\n",
      "ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,\n",
      "give utterance, in Basil Hallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had\n",
      "so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled\n",
      "surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,\n",
      "with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this man’s\n",
      "legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some\n",
      "inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams\n",
      "that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading\n",
      "canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl\n",
      "stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand,\n",
      "and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On\n",
      "a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green\n",
      "rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the\n",
      "strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of\n",
      "her temperament in him? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look\n",
      "curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and\n",
      "fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and\n",
      "swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.\n",
      "Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so\n",
      "overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century,\n",
      "and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord\n",
      "Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and\n",
      "one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How\n",
      "proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!\n",
      "What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as\n",
      "infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the\n",
      "Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his\n",
      "wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred\n",
      "within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady\n",
      "Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what he had got\n",
      "from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the\n",
      "beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.\n",
      "There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she\n",
      "was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes\n",
      "were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They\n",
      "seemed to follow him wherever he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race,\n",
      "nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly\n",
      "with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There\n",
      "were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history\n",
      "was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act\n",
      "and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it\n",
      "had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known\n",
      "them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the\n",
      "stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of\n",
      "subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had\n",
      "been his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had\n",
      "himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how,\n",
      "crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as\n",
      "Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of\n",
      "Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the\n",
      "flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had\n",
      "caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in\n",
      "an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had\n",
      "wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round\n",
      "with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his\n",
      "days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _tædium vitæ_, that comes\n",
      "on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear\n",
      "emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of\n",
      "pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the\n",
      "Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero\n",
      "Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with\n",
      "colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon\n",
      "from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the\n",
      "two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious\n",
      "tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and\n",
      "beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made\n",
      "monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted\n",
      "her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the\n",
      "dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the\n",
      "Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and\n",
      "whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the\n",
      "price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase\n",
      "living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot\n",
      "who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide\n",
      "riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;\n",
      "Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and\n",

      "and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson\n",
      "silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might\n",
      "serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy\n",
      "could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion\n",
      "for red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son of the Fiend, as\n",
      "was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling\n",
      "with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the\n",
      "name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads\n",
      "was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of\n",
      "Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the\n",
      "enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave\n",
      "poison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth\n",
      "birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where he\n",
      "had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold\n",
      "and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a\n",
      "man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of\n",
      "his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized\n",
      "him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could\n",
      "not account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on\n",
      "quickly in the direction of his own house.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the\n",

      "his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for\n",
      "you in your library ever since nine o’clock. Finally I took pity on\n",
      "your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am\n",
      "off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see\n",
      "you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as\n",
      "you passed me. But I wasn’t quite sure. Didn’t you recognize me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor\n",

      "you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a\n",
      "studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture\n",
      "I have in my head. However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk.\n",
      "Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something\n",
      "to say to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be charmed. But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian Gray\n",

      "latch-key.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his\n",
      "watch. “I have heaps of time,” he answered. “The train doesn’t go till\n",
      "twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to\n",
      "the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan’t have any\n",
      "delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with\n",
      "me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian looked at him and smiled. “What a way for a fashionable painter\n",
      "to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get\n",
      "into the house. And mind you don’t talk about anything serious. Nothing\n",
      "is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the\n",
      "library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.\n",
      "The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with\n",
      "some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little\n",
      "marqueterie table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me\n",
      "everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is\n",
      "a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman\n",
      "you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I believe he married Lady Radley’s\n",

      "_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly\n",
      "of the French, doesn’t it? But—do you know?—he was not at all a bad\n",
      "servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One\n",
      "often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted\n",
      "to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another\n",
      "brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take\n",

      "“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter, taking his cap\n",

      "Don’t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging\n",

      "myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.”\n",
      "\n",

      "most dreadful things are being said against you in London.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other\n",

      "the charm of novelty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his\n",
      "good name. You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and\n",
      "degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all\n",
      "that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind\n",
      "you, I don’t believe these rumours at all. At least, I can’t believe\n",
      "them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s\n",
      "face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.\n",
      "There are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself\n",
      "in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of\n",
      "his hands even. Somebody—I won’t mention his name, but you know\n",
      "him—came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen\n",
      "him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though\n",
      "I have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I\n",
      "refused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I\n",
      "hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.\n",
      "His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent\n",
      "face, and your marvellous untroubled youth—I can’t believe anything\n",
      "against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to\n",
      "the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these\n",
      "hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don’t know what\n",
      "to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves\n",
      "the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen\n",
      "in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You\n",
      "used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week.\n",
      "Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the\n",
      "miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley\n",
      "curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,\n",
      "but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to\n",
      "know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I\n",
      "reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.\n",
      "He told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why\n",
      "is your friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy\n",
      "in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There\n",
      "was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.\n",
      "You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his\n",
      "dreadful end? What about Lord Kent’s only son and his career? I met his\n",
      "father yesterday in St. James’s Street. He seemed broken with shame and\n",
      "sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he\n",
      "got now? What gentleman would associate with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,”\n",
      "said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt\n",
      "in his voice. “You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It\n",
      "is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows\n",
      "anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could\n",
      "his record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did\n",
      "I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent’s\n",
      "silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me? If\n",
      "Adrian Singleton writes his friend’s name across a bill, am I his\n",
      "keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air\n",
      "their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper\n",
      "about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try\n",
      "and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with\n",
      "the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to\n",
      "have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.\n",
      "And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead\n",
      "themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land\n",
      "of the hypocrite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question. England is bad\n",
      "enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why\n",
      "I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge\n",
      "of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all\n",
      "sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a\n",
      "madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them\n",
      "there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are\n",
      "smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are\n",
      "inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not\n",
      "have made his sister’s name a by-word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take care, Basil. You go too far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady\n",
      "Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a\n",
      "single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?\n",
      "Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are\n",
      "other stories—stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of\n",
      "dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in\n",
      "London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I\n",
      "laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your\n",
      "country-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don’t know\n",
      "what is said about you. I won’t tell you that I don’t want to preach to\n",
      "you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself\n",
      "into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and\n",
      "then proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want\n",
      "you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you\n",
      "to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the\n",
      "dreadful people you associate with. Don’t shrug your shoulders like\n",
      "that. Don’t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it\n",
      "be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with\n",
      "whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to\n",
      "enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I don’t know\n",
      "whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am\n",
      "told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one\n",
      "of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife\n",
      "had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.\n",
      "Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I\n",
      "told him that it was absurd—that I knew you thoroughly and that you\n",
      "were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know\n",
      "you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and\n",
      "turning almost white from fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his\n",
      "voice, “to see your soul. But only God can do that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. “You\n",
      "shall see it yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the\n",
      "table. “Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn’t you look at it?\n",
      "You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody\n",
      "would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the\n",
      "better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate\n",
      "about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough\n",
      "about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his\n",
      "foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible\n",
      "joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that\n",
      "the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his\n",
      "shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous\n",
      "memory of what he had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into\n",
      "his stern eyes, “I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that\n",
      "you fancy only God can see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward started back. “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried. “You must\n",
      "not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don’t mean\n",
      "anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think so?” He laughed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your\n",

      "\n",
      "A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face. He paused for a\n",
      "moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right\n",
      "had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of\n",
      "what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he\n",
      "straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood\n",
      "there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their\n",
      "throbbing cores of flame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned round. “What I have to say is this,” he cried. “You must give\n",
      "me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If\n",
      "you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I\n",
      "shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can’t you see what I\n",

      "and shameful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. “Come\n",
      "upstairs, Basil,” he said quietly. “I keep a diary of my life from day\n",
      "to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall\n",
      "show it to you if you come with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward\n",
      "following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at\n",
      "night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A\n",
      "rising wind made some of the windows rattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the\n",
      "floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. “You insist on\n",
      "knowing, Basil?” he asked in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat\n",
      "harshly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know\n",
      "everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you\n",
      "think”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold\n",
      "current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a\n",
      "flame of murky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he\n",
      "whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked\n",
      "as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a\n",
      "curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty\n",
      "book-case—that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a\n",
      "table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was\n",
      "standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered\n",
      "with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling\n",
      "behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that\n",
      "curtain back, and you will see mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or\n",
      "playing a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore\n",
      "the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "An exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the\n",
      "dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was\n",
      "something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.\n",
      "Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at! The\n",
      "horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous\n",
      "beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet\n",
      "on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the\n",
      "loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely\n",
      "passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it\n",
      "was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own\n",
      "brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous,\n",
      "yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the\n",
      "picture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long\n",
      "letters of bright vermilion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never\n",
      "done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if\n",
      "his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own\n",
      "picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at\n",
      "Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his\n",
      "parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across\n",
      "his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with\n",
      "that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are\n",
      "absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither\n",
      "real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the\n",
      "spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken\n",
      "the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do\n",
      "so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded\n",
      "shrill and curious in his ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in\n",
      "his hand, “you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my\n",
      "good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who\n",
      "explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me\n",
      "that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even\n",
      "now, I don’t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you\n",
      "would call it a prayer....”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is\n",
      "impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The\n",
      "paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the\n",
      "thing is impossible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the\n",
      "window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You told me you had destroyed it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was wrong. It has destroyed me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe it is my picture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My ideal, as you call it...”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As you called it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an\n",
      "ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the face of my soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a\n",
      "devil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a\n",
      "wild gesture of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. “My God! If it\n",
      "is true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your life,\n",
      "why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you\n",
      "to be!” He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The\n",
      "surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was\n",
      "from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through\n",
      "some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly\n",
      "eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was\n",
      "not so fearful.\n",
      "\n",
      "His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and\n",
      "lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he\n",
      "flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and\n",
      "buried his face in his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!” There was no\n",
      "answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. “Pray,\n",
      "Dorian, pray,” he murmured. “What is it that one was taught to say in\n",
      "one’s boyhood? ‘Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash\n",
      "away our iniquities.’ Let us say that together. The prayer of your\n",
      "pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered\n",
      "also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped\n",
      "yourself too much. We are both punished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed\n",
      "eyes. “It is too late, Basil,” he faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot\n",
      "remember a prayer. Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ‘Though your sins be\n",
      "as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those words mean nothing to me now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush! Don’t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God!\n",
      "Don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable\n",
      "feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had\n",
      "been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his\n",
      "ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred\n",
      "within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more\n",
      "than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly\n",
      "around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced\n",
      "him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he\n",
      "had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had\n",
      "forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing\n",
      "Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and\n",
      "turned round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.\n",
      "He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind\n",
      "the ear, crushing the man’s head down on the table and stabbing again\n",
      "and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking\n",
      "with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,\n",
      "waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice\n",
      "more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the\n",
      "floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he\n",
      "threw the knife on the table, and listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He\n",
      "opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely\n",
      "quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the\n",
      "balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.\n",
      "Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in\n",
      "as he did so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with\n",
      "bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been\n",
      "for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was\n",
      "slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was\n",
      "simply asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking\n",
      "over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind\n",
      "had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s\n",
      "tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the\n",
      "policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on\n",
      "the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom\n",
      "gleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl\n",
      "was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and\n",
      "then she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse\n",
      "voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She\n",
      "stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The\n",
      "gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their\n",
      "black iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the\n",
      "window behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not\n",
      "even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole\n",
      "thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the\n",
      "fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his\n",
      "life. That was enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish\n",
      "workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished\n",
      "steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed\n",
      "by his servant, and questions would be asked. He hesitated for a\n",
      "moment, then he turned back and took it from the table. He could not\n",
      "help seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the\n",
      "long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The\n",
      "woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped\n",
      "several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the\n",
      "sound of his own footsteps.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.\n",
      "They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was\n",
      "in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,\n",
      "and put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he\n",
      "pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down and began to think. Every year—every month, almost—men were\n",
      "strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of\n",
      "murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth....\n",
      "And yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left\n",
      "the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the\n",
      "servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes.\n",
      "It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he\n",
      "had intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months\n",
      "before any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything could be\n",
      "destroyed long before then.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went\n",
      "out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the\n",
      "policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the\n",
      "bull’s-eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting\n",
      "the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In\n",
      "about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very\n",
      "drowsy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping in;\n",
      "“but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock and\n",
      "blinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine\n",
      "to-morrow. I have some work to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did any one call this evening?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away\n",
      "to catch his train.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I am sorry I didn’t see him. Did he leave any message?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not\n",
      "find you at the club.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That will do, Francis. Don’t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the\n",
      "library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,\n",
      "biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one\n",
      "of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. “Alan Campbell, 152,\n",
      "Hertford Street, Mayfair.” Yes; that was the man he wanted.\n",

      "CHAPTER XIV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of\n",
      "chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite\n",
      "peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his\n",
      "cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as\n",
      "he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he\n",
      "had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all.\n",
      "His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But\n",
      "youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his\n",
      "chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The\n",
      "sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost\n",
      "like a morning in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,\n",
      "blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there\n",
      "with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had\n",
      "suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for\n",
      "Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came\n",
      "back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still\n",
      "sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!\n",
      "Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken\n",
      "or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory\n",
      "than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride\n",
      "more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of\n",
      "joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the\n",
      "senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out\n",
      "of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might\n",
      "strangle one itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and\n",
      "then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual\n",
      "care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and\n",
      "scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once. He spent a long time\n",
      "also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet\n",
      "about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the\n",
      "servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the\n",
      "letters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times\n",
      "over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.\n",
      "“That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry had once said.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly\n",
      "with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the\n",
      "table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the\n",
      "other he handed to the valet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell\n",
      "is out of town, get his address.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a\n",
      "piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and\n",
      "then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew\n",
      "seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and\n",
      "getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.\n",
      "He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until\n",
      "it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page\n",
      "of the book. It was Gautier’s “Émaux et Camées”, Charpentier’s\n",
      "Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of\n",
      "citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted\n",
      "pomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he\n",
      "turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of\n",
      "Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand “_du supplice encore mal lavée_,” with\n",
      "its downy red hairs and its “_doigts de faune_.” He glanced at his own\n",
      "white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and\n",
      "passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sur une gamme chromatique,\n",
      "    Le sein de perles ruisselant,\n",
      "La Vénus de l’Adriatique\n",
      "    Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Les dômes, sur l’azur des ondes\n",
      "    Suivant la phrase au pur contour,\n",
      "S’enflent comme des gorges rondes\n",
      "    Que soulève un soupir d’amour.\n",
      "\n",
      "L’esquif aborde et me dépose,\n",
      "    Jetant son amarre au pilier,\n",
      "Devant une façade rose,\n",
      "    Sur le marbre d’un escalier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating\n",
      "down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black\n",
      "gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked\n",
      "to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as\n",
      "one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him\n",
      "of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the\n",
      "tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through\n",
      "the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he\n",
      "kept saying over and over to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Devant une façade rose,\n",
      "Sur le marbre d’un escalier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn\n",
      "that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to\n",
      "mad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,\n",
      "like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true\n",
      "romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had\n",
      "been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor\n",
      "Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read\n",
      "of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _café_ at Smyrna\n",
      "where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned\n",
      "merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each\n",
      "other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps\n",
      "tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by\n",
      "the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red\n",
      "ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small\n",
      "beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood\n",
      "over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell\n",
      "of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the\n",
      "“_monstre charmant_” that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.\n",
      "But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a\n",
      "horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be\n",
      "out of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he\n",
      "might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been great friends once, five years before—almost inseparable,\n",
      "indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in\n",
      "society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never\n",
      "did.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real\n",
      "appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the\n",
      "beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His\n",
      "dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had\n",
      "spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken\n",
      "a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was\n",
      "still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his\n",
      "own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the\n",
      "annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for\n",
      "Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up\n",
      "prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and\n",
      "played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In\n",
      "fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray\n",
      "together—music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be\n",
      "able to exercise whenever he wished—and, indeed, exercised often\n",
      "without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire’s the\n",
      "night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always\n",
      "seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For\n",
      "eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at\n",
      "Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian\n",
      "Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in\n",
      "life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever\n",
      "knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they\n",
      "met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at\n",
      "which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too—was strangely\n",
      "melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and\n",
      "would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called\n",
      "upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in\n",
      "which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to\n",
      "become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice\n",
      "in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious\n",
      "experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept\n",
      "glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly\n",
      "agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,\n",
      "looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.\n",
      "His hands were curiously cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with\n",
      "feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the\n",
      "jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting\n",
      "for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands\n",
      "his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight\n",
      "and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The brain\n",
      "had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made\n",
      "grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,\n",
      "danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving\n",
      "masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,\n",
      "slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being\n",
      "dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its\n",
      "grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him\n",
      "stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes\n",
      "upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Campbell, sir,” said the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back\n",
      "to his cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.” He felt that he was himself\n",
      "again. His mood of cowardice had passed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,\n",
      "looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his\n",
      "coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it\n",
      "was a matter of life and death.” His voice was hard and cold. He spoke\n",
      "with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady\n",
      "searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the\n",
      "pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the\n",
      "gesture with which he had been greeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one\n",
      "person. Sit down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The\n",
      "two men’s eyes met. In Dorian’s there was infinite pity. He knew that\n",
      "what he was going to do was dreadful.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very\n",
      "quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he\n",
      "had sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room\n",
      "to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.\n",
      "He has been dead ten hours now. Don’t stir, and don’t look at me like\n",
      "that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not\n",
      "concern you. What you have to do is this—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop, Gray. I don’t want to know anything further. Whether what you\n",
      "have told me is true or not true doesn’t concern me. I entirely decline\n",
      "to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.\n",
      "They don’t interest me any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest\n",
      "you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can’t help myself. You are\n",
      "the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the\n",
      "matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about\n",
      "chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you\n",
      "have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs—to destroy it\n",
      "so that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come\n",
      "into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in\n",
      "Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must\n",
      "be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and\n",
      "everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may\n",
      "scatter in the air.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are mad, Dorian.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to\n",

      "sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of\n",
      "all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have\n",

      "kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A\n",
      "fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was\n",

      "\n",
      "After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Campbell frowned and bit his lip. “It will take about five hours,” he\n",
      "answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,\n",
      "Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have\n",

      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!\n",
      "I’ll take it for you. You bring the other things.” He spoke rapidly and\n",
      "in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left\n",
      "the room together.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned\n",
      "it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is nothing to me. I don’t require you,” said Campbell coldly.\n",
      "\n",

      "portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn\n",
      "curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had\n",
      "forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,\n",
      "and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on\n",
      "one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible\n",
      "it was!—more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent\n",
      "thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose\n",
      "grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had\n",
      "not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with\n",
      "half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that\n",
      "he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and\n",
      "taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the\n",
      "picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed\n",
      "themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard\n",
      "Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other\n",
      "things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder\n",
      "if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had\n",
      "thought of each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave me now,” said a stern voice behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been\n",
      "thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a\n",
      "glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the key\n",
      "being turned in the lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He\n",
      "was pale, but absolutely calm. “I have done what you asked me to do,”\n",
      "he muttered. “And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,” said Dorian\n",
      "simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible\n",
      "smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large\n",
      "button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady\n",
      "Narborough’s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was\n",
      "throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his\n",
      "manner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as\n",
      "ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to\n",
      "play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could\n",
      "have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any\n",
      "tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have\n",
      "clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God\n",
      "and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his\n",
      "demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a\n",
      "double life.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who\n",
      "was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the\n",
      "remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife\n",
      "to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband\n",
      "properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and\n",
      "married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted\n",
      "herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and\n",
      "French _esprit_ when she could get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that\n",
      "she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. “I know, my\n",
      "dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say,\n",
      "“and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most\n",
      "fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our\n",
      "bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to\n",
      "raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.\n",
      "However, that was all Narborough’s fault. He was dreadfully\n",
      "short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who\n",
      "never sees anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she\n",
      "explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married\n",
      "daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make\n",
      "matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. “I think it\n",
      "is most unkind of her, my dear,” she whispered. “Of course I go and\n",
      "stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old\n",
      "woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake\n",
      "them up. You don’t know what an existence they lead down there. It is\n",
      "pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have\n",
      "so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to\n",
      "think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since\n",
      "the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep\n",
      "after dinner. You shan’t sit next either of them. You shall sit by me\n",
      "and amuse me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:\n",
      "it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen\n",
      "before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those\n",
      "middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,\n",
      "but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an\n",
      "overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always\n",
      "trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to\n",
      "her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against\n",
      "her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and\n",
      "Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess’s daughter, a dowdy\n",
      "dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once\n",
      "seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,\n",
      "white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the\n",
      "impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of\n",
      "ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the\n",
      "great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the\n",
      "mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: “How horrid of Henry Wotton to be\n",
      "so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised\n",
      "faithfully not to disappoint me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door\n",
      "opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some\n",
      "insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away\n",
      "untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an\n",
      "insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,” and\n",
      "now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence\n",
      "and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his glass\n",
      "with champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian,” said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being\n",
      "handed round, “what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out\n",
      "of sorts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is\n",
      "afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I\n",
      "certainly should.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in\n",
      "love for a whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady.\n",
      "“I really cannot understand it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,\n",
      "Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and\n",
      "your short frocks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I\n",
      "remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _décolletée_\n",
      "she was then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is still _décolletée_,” he answered, taking an olive in his long\n",
      "fingers; “and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an\n",
      "_édition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and\n",
      "full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.\n",
      "When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess. “But her\n",
      "third husband, Lord Henry! You don’t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian. “I asked her\n",
      "whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and\n",
      "hung at her girdle. She told me she didn’t, because none of them had\n",

      "like? I don’t know him.”\n",

      "“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,”\n",

      "surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.”\n",

      "“It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent\n",
      "terms.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady,\n",
      "shaking her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. “It is perfectly\n",

      "rejoinder. “Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,\n",
      "they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never\n",

      "\n",
      "“Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for\n",

      "that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes\n",

      "\n",
      "“Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done\n",

      "and nodding to Lady Ruxton. “You must come and dine with me soon again.\n",
      "You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew\n",

      "sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the\n",
      "situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The\n",
      "word _doctrinaire_—word full of terror to the British mind—reappeared\n",
      "from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served\n",
      "as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles\n",
      "of thought. The inherited stupidity of the race—sound English common\n",

      "“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very\n",
      "clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of\n",
      "weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image\n",
      "precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.\n",
      "White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and\n",
      "what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is\n",
      "ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,\n",

      "“I like him,” said Lord Henry. “A great many people don’t, but I find\n",

      "\n",

      "“Yes,” he answered. Then he bit his lip. “No, I don’t mean that. I\n",

      "inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been\n",
      "doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at\n",
      "half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my\n",
      "latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any\n",
      "corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let\n",
      "us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.\n",
      "Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not\n",
      "yourself to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come\n",
      "round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady\n",
      "Narborough. I shan’t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.”\n",

      "“All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.\n",
      "The duchess is coming.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room. As he drove\n",
      "back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he\n",
      "thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henry’s casual\n",
      "questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted\n",
      "his nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He\n",
      "winced. He hated the idea of even touching them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the\n",
      "door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had\n",
      "thrust Basil Hallward’s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled\n",
      "another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning\n",
      "leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume\n",
      "everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some\n",
      "Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and\n",
      "forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed\n",
      "nervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large\n",
      "Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue\n",
      "lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and\n",
      "make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet\n",
      "almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He\n",
      "lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the\n",
      "long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the\n",
      "cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,\n",
      "went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A\n",
      "triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively\n",
      "towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese\n",
      "box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides\n",
      "patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round\n",
      "crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside\n",
      "was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and\n",
      "persistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his\n",
      "face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly\n",
      "hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes\n",
      "to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did\n",
      "so, and went into his bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,\n",
      "dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept\n",
      "quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good\n",
      "horse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man shook his head. “It is too far for me,” he muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian. “You shall have another if\n",
      "you drive fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an hour,” and\n",

      "CHAPTER XVI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly\n",
      "in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men\n",
      "and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some\n",
      "of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards\n",
      "brawled and screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian\n",
      "Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and\n",
      "now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said\n",
      "to him on the first day they had met, “To cure the soul by means of the\n",
      "senses, and the senses by means of the soul.” Yes, that was the secret.\n",
      "He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium\n",
      "dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of\n",
      "old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a\n",
      "huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The\n",
      "gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the\n",
      "man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from\n",
      "the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom\n",
      "were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of\n",
      "the soul!” How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was\n",
      "sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent\n",
      "blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there\n",
      "was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness\n",
      "was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing\n",
      "out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.\n",
      "Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who\n",
      "had made him a judge over others? He had said things that were\n",
      "dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.\n",
      "\n",
      "On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each\n",
      "step. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The\n",
      "hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and\n",
      "his delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse\n",
      "madly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in\n",
      "answer, and the man was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some\n",
      "sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist\n",
      "thickened, he felt afraid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and\n",
      "he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,\n",
      "fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in\n",
      "the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a\n",
      "rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over\n",
      "rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then\n",
      "fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He\n",
      "watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made\n",
      "gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his heart.\n",
      "As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open\n",
      "door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The\n",
      "driver beat at them with his whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with\n",
      "hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped\n",
      "those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in\n",
      "them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by\n",
      "intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would\n",
      "still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept\n",
      "the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all\n",
      "man’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.\n",
      "Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,\n",
      "became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one\n",
      "reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of\n",
      "disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more\n",
      "vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious\n",
      "shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for\n",
      "forgetfulness. In three days he would be free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over\n",
      "the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black\n",
      "masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the\n",
      "yards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily through the\n",
      "trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian started and peered round. “This will do,” he answered, and\n",
      "having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had\n",
      "promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and\n",
      "there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The\n",
      "light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an\n",
      "outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like\n",
      "a wet mackintosh.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he\n",
      "was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small\n",
      "shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of\n",
      "the top-windows stood a lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being\n",
      "unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word\n",
      "to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as\n",
      "he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that\n",
      "swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the\n",
      "street. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as\n",
      "if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring\n",
      "gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced\n",
      "them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin\n",
      "backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered\n",
      "with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and\n",
      "stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching\n",
      "by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing\n",
      "their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head\n",
      "buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily\n",
      "painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women,\n",
      "mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an\n",
      "expression of disgust. “He thinks he’s got red ants on him,” laughed\n",
      "one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror and\n",
      "began to whimper.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a\n",
      "darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the\n",
      "heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils\n",
      "quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow\n",
      "hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up\n",
      "at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly. “None of the chaps\n",
      "will speak to me now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you had left England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at\n",
      "last. George doesn’t speak to me either.... I don’t care,” he added\n",
      "with a sigh. “As long as one has this stuff, one doesn’t want friends.\n",
      "I think I have had too many friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such\n",
      "fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the\n",
      "gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in\n",
      "what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were\n",
      "teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he\n",
      "was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was\n",
      "eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of\n",
      "Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The\n",
      "presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one\n",
      "would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going on to the other place,” he said after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the wharf?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",

      "it matter to him? One’s days were too brief to take the burden of\n",
      "another’s errors on one’s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and\n",

      "He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the\n",

      "to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping\n",
      "along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him\n",
      "with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked\n",

      "A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby\n",
      "Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,\n",
      "a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time,\n",
      "and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the\n",
      "table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at\n",
      "which the duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving daintily\n",
      "among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that\n",
      "Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped\n",
      "wicker chair, looking at them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady\n",
      "Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke’s description of the last\n",
      "Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. Three young men\n",
      "in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.\n",
      "The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more\n",
      "expected to arrive on the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are you two talking about?” said Lord Henry, strolling over to\n",
      "the table and putting his cup down. “I hope Dorian has told you about\n",
      "my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t want to be rechristened, Harry,” rejoined the duchess,\n",
      "looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. “I am quite satisfied with\n",
      "my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are\n",
      "both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an\n",
      "orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as\n",
      "effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one\n",
      "of the gardeners what it was called. He told me it was a fine specimen\n",
      "of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad\n",
      "truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.\n",
      "Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is\n",
      "with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The\n",
      "man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It\n",

      "“Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.\n",

      "\n",
      "“How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be\n",

      "Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.\n",
      "Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely\n",

      "\n",
      "The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the\n",
      "time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet\n",
      "indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,\n",
      "tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but\n",
      "tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against\n",
      "the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild\n",
      "regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor’s face\n",
      "peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to\n",
      "lay its hand upon his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of\n",
      "the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual\n",
      "life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the\n",
      "imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of\n",
      "sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen\n",
      "brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor\n",
      "the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon\n",
      "the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round\n",
      "the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers. Had\n",
      "any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have\n",
      "reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane’s brother had\n",
      "not come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in\n",
      "some winter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did\n",
      "not know who he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had\n",
      "saved him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think\n",
      "that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them\n",
      "visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would\n",
      "his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from\n",
      "silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear\n",
      "as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!\n",
      "As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and\n",
      "the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a\n",
      "wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere\n",
      "memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back\n",
      "to him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and\n",
      "swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in\n",
      "at six o’clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was\n",
      "something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that\n",
      "seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it\n",
      "was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused\n",
      "the change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish\n",
      "that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle\n",
      "and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions\n",
      "must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves\n",
      "die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows\n",
      "that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had\n",
      "convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken\n",
      "imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity\n",
      "and not a little of contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden\n",
      "and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp\n",
      "frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue\n",
      "metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey\n",
      "Clouston, the duchess’s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of\n",
      "his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the\n",
      "mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken\n",
      "and rough undergrowth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the\n",
      "open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new\n",
      "ground.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and\n",
      "red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters\n",
      "ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that\n",
      "followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful\n",
      "freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high\n",
      "indifference of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front\n",
      "of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it\n",
      "forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir\n",
      "Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the\n",
      "animal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he\n",
      "cried out at once, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded\n",
      "into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a\n",
      "hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is\n",
      "worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens! I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. “What an\n",
      "ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!” he\n",
      "called out at the top of his voice. “A man is hurt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where, sir? Where is he?” he shouted. At the same time, the firing\n",
      "ceased along the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.\n",
      "“Why on earth don’t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the\n",
      "day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the\n",
      "lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging\n",
      "a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It\n",
      "seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir\n",
      "Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of\n",
      "the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with\n",
      "faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of\n",
      "voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the\n",
      "boughs overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state, like\n",
      "endless hours of pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started\n",
      "and looked round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the shooting is\n",
      "stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly. “The\n",
      "whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not finish the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry. “He got the whole charge of shot\n",
      "in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go\n",
      "home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly\n",
      "fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and\n",
      "said, with a heavy sigh, “It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is?” asked Lord Henry. “Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear\n",
      "fellow, it can’t be helped. It was the man’s own fault. Why did he get\n",
      "in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather\n",
      "awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It\n",
      "makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he\n",
      "shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian shook his head. “It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something\n",
      "horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,” he\n",
      "added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elder man laughed. “The only horrible thing in the world is\n",
      "_ennui_, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.\n",
      "But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep\n",
      "chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the\n",
      "subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an\n",
      "omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel\n",
      "for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have\n",
      "everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would\n",
      "not be delighted to change places with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don’t\n",
      "laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who\n",
      "has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is\n",
      "the coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to\n",
      "wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don’t you see a man\n",
      "moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand\n",
      "was pointing. “Yes,” he said, smiling, “I see the gardener waiting for\n",
      "you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the\n",
      "table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must\n",
      "come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The\n",
      "man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating\n",
      "manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. “Her\n",
      "Grace told me to wait for an answer,” he murmured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian put the letter into his pocket. “Tell her Grace that I am coming\n",
      "in,” he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the\n",
      "direction of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry. “It\n",
      "is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt\n",
      "with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present\n",
      "instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I\n",
      "don’t love her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you\n",
      "are excellently matched.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for\n",
      "scandal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,” said Lord Henry,\n",
      "lighting a cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The world goes to the altar of its own accord,” was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I could love,” cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in\n",
      "his voice. “But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the\n",
      "desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has\n",
      "become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was\n",
      "silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to\n",
      "Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what\n",
      "it is? You know I would help you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly. “And I dare say it is\n",
      "only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a\n",
      "horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What nonsense!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,\n",
      "looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,\n",
      "Duchess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered. “Poor Geoffrey is\n",
      "terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.\n",
      "How curious!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it was very curious. I don’t know what made me say it. Some whim,\n",
      "I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am\n",
      "sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry. “It has no\n",
      "psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on\n",
      "purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one\n",
      "who had committed a real murder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess. “Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?\n",
      "Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. “It is nothing,\n",
      "Duchess,” he murmured; “my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is\n",
      "all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn’t hear what\n",
      "Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think\n",
      "I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the\n",
      "conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,\n",
      "Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.\n",
      "“Are you very much in love with him?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. “I\n",
      "wish I knew,” she said at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shook his head. “Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty\n",
      "that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One may lose one’s way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Disillusion.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He glanced about as if in search of something. “What are you looking\n",
      "for?” she inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The button from your foil,” he answered. “You have dropped it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed. “I have still the mask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It makes your eyes lovelier,” was his reply.\n",

      "beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to\n",
      "pre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at what Lord\n",

      "\n",
      "“Some money, sir—not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don’t like to\n",

      "path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.\n",
      "He lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air\n",
      "like an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.\n",
      "He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the\n",
      "farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him\n",
      "that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand\n",
      "upon the latch.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a\n",

      "\n",
      "On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man\n",
      "dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted\n",

      "bottle, sputtered beside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take\n",

      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray shook his head. “No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful\n",

      "\n",
      "“Where were you yesterday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry, smiling, “anybody can be good in the\n",
      "country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people\n",
      "who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not\n",
      "by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by\n",
      "which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being\n",
      "corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they\n",
      "stagnate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Culture and corruption,” echoed Dorian. “I have known something of\n",
      "both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found\n",
      "together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I\n",

      "\n",
      "“You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you\n",

      "perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else.\n",
      "I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She\n",
      "was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was\n",
      "that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don’t you?\n",
      "How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of\n",
      "course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I\n",
      "am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we\n",
      "have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a\n",
      "week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept\n",
      "tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone\n",
      "away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her\n",
      "as flowerlike as I had found her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill\n",
      "of real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry. “But I can finish\n",
      "your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That\n",
      "was the beginning of your reformation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harry, you are horrible! You mustn’t say these dreadful things.\n",
      "Hetty’s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But\n",
      "there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her\n",
      "garden of mint and marigold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as he\n",
      "leaned back in his chair. “My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously\n",
      "boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now\n",
      "with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to\n",
      "a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met\n",
      "you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will\n",
      "be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much\n",
      "of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides,\n",
      "how do you know that Hetty isn’t floating at the present moment in some\n",
      "starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?”\n",
      "\n",

      "most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don’t care what\n",
      "you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I\n",
      "rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window,\n",
      "like a spray of jasmine. Don’t let us talk about it any more, and don’t\n",
      "try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years,\n",
      "the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a\n",

      "“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and\n",
      "the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having\n",
      "more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate\n",
      "lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell’s\n",
      "suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.\n",
      "Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left\n",
      "for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor\n",
      "Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris\n",
      "at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has\n",
      "been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who\n",

      "\n",
      "“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up his\n",
      "Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could\n",
      "discuss the matter so calmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is\n",
      "no business of mine. If he is dead, I don’t want to think about him.\n",
      "Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” said the younger man wearily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt\n",
      "trellis of an open vinaigrette box, “one can survive everything\n",
      "nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the\n",
      "nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee\n",
      "in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with\n",
      "whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was\n",
      "very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her. Of course,\n",
      "married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the\n",
      "loss even of one’s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most.\n",
      "They are such an essential part of one’s personality.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next\n",
      "room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white\n",
      "and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he\n",
      "stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever\n",
      "occur to you that Basil was murdered?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Henry yawned. “Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury\n",
      "watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to\n",
      "have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a\n",
      "man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was\n",
      "really rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he\n",
      "told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you\n",
      "were the dominant motive of his art.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian with a note of sadness in his\n",
      "voice. “But don’t people say that he was murdered?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all\n",
      "probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not\n",
      "the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his\n",
      "chief defect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?”\n",
      "said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had spoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that\n",
      "doesn’t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.\n",
      "It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your\n",
      "vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs\n",
      "exclusively to the lower orders. I don’t blame them in the smallest\n",
      "degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply\n",
      "a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who\n",
      "has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?\n",
      "Don’t tell me that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried Lord\n",
      "Henry, laughing. “That is one of the most important secrets of life. I\n",
      "should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should\n",
      "never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us\n",
      "pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a\n",
      "really romantic end as you suggest, but I can’t. I dare say he fell\n",
      "into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the\n",
      "scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on\n",
      "his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating\n",
      "over him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don’t\n",
      "think he would have done much more good work. During the last ten years\n",
      "his painting had gone off very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began\n",
      "to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged\n",
      "bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo\n",
      "perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of\n",
      "crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards\n",
      "and forwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of\n",
      "his pocket; “his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have\n",
      "lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be\n",
      "great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated\n",
      "you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. It’s a habit\n",
      "bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he\n",
      "did of you? I don’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh!\n",
      "I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to\n",
      "Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way. You never got\n",
      "it back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted\n",
      "to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil’s best period. Since\n",
      "then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good\n",
      "intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative\n",
      "British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forget,” said Dorian. “I suppose I did. But I never really liked it.\n",
      "I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me. Why\n",
      "do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some\n",
      "play—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like the painting of a sorrow,\n",
      "A face without a heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes: that is what it was like.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.\n",

      "heart.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. “By the\n",
      "way, Dorian,” he said after a pause, “‘what does it profit a man if he\n",

      "soul’?”\n",

      "“My dear fellow,” said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,\n",
      "“I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.\n",
      "That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the\n",
      "Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people\n",
      "listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the\n",
      "man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being\n",
      "rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A\n",
      "wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly\n",
      "white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful\n",
      "phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips—it was really very\n",
      "good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet\n",
      "that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he\n",
      "would not have understood me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and\n",
      "sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is\n",
      "a soul in each one of us. I know it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Quite sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely\n",
      "certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the\n",
      "lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don’t be so serious. What have\n",
      "you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up\n",
      "our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,\n",
      "and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your\n",
      "youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you\n",
      "are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful,\n",
      "Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You\n",
      "remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy,\n",
      "and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in\n",
      "appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth\n",
      "I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early,\n",
      "or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It’s absurd to talk\n",
      "of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen\n",
      "now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in\n",
      "front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the\n",
      "aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask\n",
      "them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly\n",
      "give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks,\n",
      "believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that\n",
      "thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca,\n",
      "with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against\n",
      "the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that\n",
      "there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don’t stop. I want\n",

      "brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you\n",

      "ceased to play—I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that\n",
      "our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own\n",

      "with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has\n",
      "always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of\n",
      "what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am\n",
      "so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or\n",
      "painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has\n",
      "been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your\n",
      "sonnets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.\n",
      "“Yes, life has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to\n",
      "have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant\n",
      "things to me. You don’t know everything about me. I think that if you\n",
      "did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don’t laugh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne\n",
      "over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the\n",
      "dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she\n",
      "will come closer to the earth. You won’t? Let us go to the club, then.\n",
      "It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is\n",
      "some one at White’s who wants immensely to know you—young Lord Poole,\n",
      "Bournemouth’s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has\n",
      "begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather\n",
      "reminds me of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope not,” said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. “But I am tired\n",
      "to-night, Harry. I shan’t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I\n",
      "want to go to bed early.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was\n",
      "something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than\n",
      "I had ever heard from it before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling. “I am a\n",
      "little changed already.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot change to me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry. “You and I will\n",
      "always be friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.\n",
      "Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It\n",
      "does harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be\n",
      "going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people\n",
      "against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too\n",
      "delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we\n",
      "are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,\n",
      "there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It\n",
      "annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that\n",
      "the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.\n",
      "That is all. But we won’t discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I\n",
      "am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you\n",
      "to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and\n",
      "wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.\n",
      "Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she\n",
      "never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you\n",
      "would be. Her clever tongue gets on one’s nerves. Well, in any case, be\n",
      "here at eleven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must I really come, Harry?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Very well. I shall be here at eleven,” said Dorian. “Good night,\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and\n",
      "did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home,\n",
      "smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He\n",
      "heard one of them whisper to the other, “That is Dorian Gray.” He\n",
      "remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared\n",
      "at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the\n",
      "charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that\n",
      "no one knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to\n",
      "love him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her\n",
      "once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that\n",
      "wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she\n",
      "had!—just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her\n",
      "cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had\n",
      "everything that he had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent\n",
      "him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and\n",
      "began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing\n",
      "for the unstained purity of his boyhood—his rose-white boyhood, as Lord\n",
      "Henry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled\n",
      "his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had\n",
      "been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in\n",
      "being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been\n",
      "the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.\n",
      "But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that\n",
      "the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the\n",
      "unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to\n",
      "that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure\n",
      "swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not\n",
      "“Forgive us our sins” but “Smite us for our iniquities” should be the\n",
      "prayer of man to a most just God.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many\n",
      "years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids\n",
      "laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night\n",
      "of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and\n",
      "with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some\n",
      "one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending\n",
      "with these idolatrous words: “The world is changed because you are made\n",
      "of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.” The\n",
      "phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to\n",
      "himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the\n",
      "floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his\n",
      "beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed\n",
      "for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from\n",
      "stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.\n",
      "What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow\n",
      "moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had\n",
      "spoiled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It\n",
      "was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane\n",
      "was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had\n",
      "shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the\n",
      "secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was,\n",
      "over Basil Hallward’s disappearance would soon pass away. It was\n",
      "already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the\n",
      "death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the\n",
      "living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the\n",
      "portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It\n",
      "was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him\n",
      "that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The\n",
      "murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,\n",
      "his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was\n",
      "nothing to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for.\n",
      "Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at\n",
      "any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\n",
      "the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it\n",
      "had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\n",
      "every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had\n",
      "already gone away. He would go and look.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the\n",
      "door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\n",
      "and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and\n",
      "the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\n",
      "to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\n",
      "dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and\n",
      "indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the\n",
      "eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\n",
      "the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if\n",
      "possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\n",
      "brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it\n",
      "been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the\n",
      "desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\n",
      "laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\n",
      "finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the\n",
      "red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a\n",
      "horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the\n",
      "painted feet, as though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand\n",
      "that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to\n",
      "confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt\n",
      "that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would\n",
      "believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\n",
      "Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned\n",
      "what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\n",
      "They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his\n",
      "duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.\n",
      "There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well\n",
      "as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had\n",
      "told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of\n",
      "Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty\n",
      "Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he\n",
      "was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing\n",
      "more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At\n",
      "least he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing\n",
      "more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the\n",
      "mask of goodness. For curiosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self.\n",
      "He recognized that now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be\n",
      "burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only\n",
      "one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself—that was\n",
      "evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had\n",
      "given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had\n",
      "felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been\n",
      "away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon\n",
      "it. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had\n",
      "marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it\n",
      "had been conscience. He would destroy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He\n",
      "had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was\n",
      "bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill\n",
      "the painter’s work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,\n",
      "and when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous\n",
      "soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He\n",
      "seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its\n",
      "agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\n",
      "Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\n",
      "up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and\n",
      "brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no\n",
      "answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all\n",
      "dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and\n",
      "watched.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of\n",
      "them was Sir Henry Ashton’s uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics\n",
      "were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\n",
      "and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.\n",
      "\n",
      "After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\n",
      "footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They\n",
      "called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force\n",
      "the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The\n",
      "windows yielded easily—their bolts were old.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\n",
      "of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\n",
      "exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\n",
      "evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,\n",
      "and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings\n",
